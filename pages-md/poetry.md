I write poetry _almost_ every day, most of it isn't very good nor very long - but I enjoy the process of distilling my thoughts into a few couplets. Enjoy!

<h2 id="closer">Closer</h2>
<p>May 08, 2024</p>

To feel closer to something, <br />
is to feel some familiar sense of longing. <br />
To be closer to something, <br />
is to be at peace with a renewed sense of meaning.

<hr />


<h2 id="freewill">Free Will</h2>
<p>May 04, 2024</p>

As you stand on the edge of a waterfall, <br />
you ask yourself, "why am I above it all?" <br />
Did you come here on your own? <br />
"Of course I did, not behest to the throne." <br />
But you think and start to realize, <br />
that whatever had happened, you'd be here, on the throughline.

<hr />

<h2 id="delays">Delays</h2>
<p>May 03, 2024</p>

What can one do but stare, <br />
in the abyss as his arrival becomes rare. <br />
In the end, "does anyone care?" <br />
But in the end, at least you dared.

<hr />


<h2 id="honour">Honour</h2>
<p>May 02, 2024</p>

Redemption, measurable it is not. <br />
But whose there to count? One caught <br />
in the act isn't to care. <br />
But taking that first step? <br />
Only few men would dare.

<hr />

<h2 id="mayday">Mayday</h2>
<p>May 01, 2024</p>

Mayday! Mayday! <br />
But we stand in fear. <br />
A fear that's gripping, <br />
us all, a song leaving them in tears.

<hr />


<h2 id="reflection">Reflection</h2>

![Ocean](/ocean.jpg)

Gaze your eyes upon the ocean, <br />
where man often refines their notion. <br />
As you walk away from the sun, <br />
you'll find the true meaning of a job well done.

<hr />

<h2 id="lakeside">Dread</h2>
<p>Apr 26, 2024</p>

Dread is a funny little game, <br />
thinking, thinking, thinking, a shame. <br />
Because imagine what one can do, <br />
if that time was spent on what's true.

<hr />

<h2 id="lakeside">Lakeside</h2>
<p>Apr 25, 2024</p>

Here I am, by the lakeside, <br />
where no one's around to turn me to faith's side. <br />
But what's one to do, <br />
if and when a man reaches his waste side?
