I write poetry every day, most of it isn't very good nor very long - but I enjoy the process of distilling my thoughts into a few couplets. Enjoy!

Here I am, by the lakeside, <br />
where no one's around to turn me to faith's side. <br />
But what's one to do, <br />
if and when a man reaches his waste side?
