## <span id="a-fresh-start">A Fresh Start</span>

Pen down these words, <br />
for they fade easily. <br />
The laws of cause and effect aren't meandering  <br />
So do something now, rather than fleetingly. 

<hr />

## <span id="ideal-situations">Ideal Situations</span>

Idealism isn't a young man's game, <br />
for delusions often make him tame. <br />
"Is our sole purpose to live our story? <br />
or is it to write our own history?"

<hr />

## <span id="highway-star">Highway Star</span>

There's a shooting star in place, <br />
stationary yet lacking any complacency. <br />
Who's one to stop it? Who's one to control it? <br />
Only _it_, can find its pathway forward.

<hr />

## <span id="coming-home">Coming Home</span>

![Tunnel](/tunnel.png)

The crack of dawn, with its radiant rays, <br />
casts a shadow of doubt on your outlook. <br />
But when the people start chiming, the words start flowing, <br />
that's when all seems right in place.

<hr />


## <span id="wrath-of-man">Wrath of Man</span>

No mercy from the ghost within, <br />
blinded by the ashes of the past. <br />
"Wither!" under looming shadow cast, <br />
Herein, lies the wrath of man.

<hr />

## <span id="borealis">Borealis</span>

The aura around you scares you from within, <br />
"But alas, how can I change, <br />
won't they end up finding me a little strange?" <br />
So you cast that thought away, <br />
and lay down to watch the Borealis <br />
enchant you today.

<hr />

## <span id="animals-all-of-them">Animals, All of Them</span>

The gallows echo with laughter, <br />
for the hangman played his last letter. <br />
"A bad man", they all say. <br />
"Animals, All of Them" is all you can say.

<hr />

## <span id="headache">Headache</span>

Ash from the timber flows through you, <br />
the trigger is in place too. <br />
All one can do is wait and see, <br />
and hope for their headache to _subceed_.

<hr />

## <span id="closer">Closer</span>

To feel closer to something, <br />
is to feel some familiar sense of longing. <br />
To be closer to something, <br />
is to be at peace with a renewed sense of meaning.

<hr />


## <span id="freewill">Free Will</span>

As you stand on the edge of a waterfall, <br />
you ask yourself, "why am I above it all?" <br />
Did you come here on your own? <br />
"Of course I did, not behest to the throne." <br />
But you think and start to realize, <br />
that whatever had happened, you'd be here, on the throughline.

<hr />

## <span id="delays">Delays</span>

What can one do but stare, <br />
in the abyss as his arrival becomes rare. <br />
In the end, "does anyone care?" <br />
But in the end, at least you dared.

<hr />


## <span id="honour">Honour</span>

Redemption, measurable it is not. <br />
But whose there to count? One caught <br />
in the act isn't to care. <br />
But taking that first step? <br />
Only few men would dare.

<hr />

## <span id="mayday">Mayday</span>

Mayday! Mayday! <br />
But we stand in fear. <br />
A fear that's gripping, <br />
us all, a song leaving them in tears.

<hr />


## <span id="reflection">Reflection</span>

![Ocean](/ocean.jpg)

Gaze your eyes upon the ocean, <br />
where man often refines their notion. <br />
As you walk away from the sun, <br />
you'll find the true meaning of a job well done.

<hr />

## <span id="lakeside">Dread</span>

Dread is a funny little game, <br />
thinking, thinking, thinking, a shame. <br />
Because imagine what one can do, <br />
if that time was spent on what's true.

<hr />

## <span id="lakeside">Lakeside</span>

Here I am, by the lakeside, <br />
where no one's around to turn me to faith's side. <br />
But what's one to do, <br />
if and when a man reaches his waste side?
