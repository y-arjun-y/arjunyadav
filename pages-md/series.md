<h2 id="replacement-posts">Replacement Posts</h2>

I've missed my goal of posting a blog post at least once a month (excluding my [interesting reads](/#interesting-reads) series) a couple of times, here are all the replacement posts:

- [Results from DALLÂ·E 2 (Part 2)](/blog/results-from-dalle-2-part-2) (replacement post for October 2022)
- [Distillation of The Offense-Defense Balance of Scientific Knowledge](/blog/distillation-of-the-offense-defense-balance-of-scientific-knowledge) (replacement post for July 2022)

[^1]: Well, not _everything_ everything, only most newsletters, articles/posts and books. But you get the point.
