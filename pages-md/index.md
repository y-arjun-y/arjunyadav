## Hello!

<img src="/collage.png" />

My name is Arjun Yadav (pronounced /ˈɑːɹ.dʒʌn ˈjɑː.dʌv/).

As of now, I work on the tech side of [Kickstart Global](https://kickstartglobal.com) as well as sales at [AIESEC Manchester](https://www.aiesec.co.uk/). In addition, I'm studying Computer Science at the University of Manchester.

My interests lie in [effective altruism](/blog/what-is-effective-altruism), [computer science](https://github.com/y-arjun-y) (more specifically in web development, [machine learning](/notebook) and [AI safety](/notebook/)) and [writing on my blog](/blog/) (click [here](/subscribe) to subscribe).

My avid interests in life right now are running, hiking, practicing different musical instruments (drums, ukulele and harmonica) and getting better at writing [poetry](/poetry).

Feel free to email me at arjun (at) arjunyadav (dot) net or schedule out time to chat with me [here](https://calendly.com/arjun-yadav).
