## Hello!

<img src="/Arjun.png" height="350px" />

My name is Arjun Yadav, my interests lie in [effective altruism](/blog/what-is-effective-altruism), [computer science](https://github.com/y-arjun-y) (more specifically in web development and machine learning) and [writing on my blog](/blog/) (I post at least once a month[^1], excluding my [interesting reads](/interesting-reads/) series).

Check out my projects [here](/projects/) and feel free to [contact me](https://www.bettermailto.com/user/620278e0561f820009d840d2).

[^1]: I've missed this goal once, [here are all the replacement posts](/replacement-posts/).
