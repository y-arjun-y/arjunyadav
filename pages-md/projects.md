- <time>Nov 27, 2021</time> Completed [Power of Three](https://leetcode.com/problems/power-of-three/), thus ending the power saga (though I had to look at the solution as I didn't know I needed to use `np.log10()` instead of `np.log()`) I also got another response for my post.

```py

```

- <time>Nov 25, 2021</time> Completed [Power of Two](https://leetcode.com/problems/power-of-two/), though I had to use [numpy](https://numpy.org/) so I don't think my solution really counts, but here's the solution anyways:

```py
class Solution:
    def isPowerOfTwo(self, n: int) -> bool:
        import numpy as np

        if (np.log2(n)).is_integer():

- <time>May 13, 2022</time> Finished with the Personal Library project by intentionally leaving a test case broken :/ ([here](https://personal-library-project.yarjuny.repl.co/) it is) Also continued with beta Responsive Web Design.

- <time>May 12, 2022</time> AAAAAAAAAA This is a really complicated situation: I wrote all the functional tests and a) Replit keeps crashing after all the tests pass (unless I do a weird port trick) b) Even though the `POST` comment test case works without the tests, it refuses to pass after all the tests pass. This is probably the second or third most frustrating project I worked on (the most frustrating was probably the JavaScript calculator)

- <time>May 11, 2022</time> Got the comment `POST` test case to pass, on to the `GET` test case. Also continued with beta Responsive Web Design.

- <time>Apr 28, 2022</time> Finished those last two non-test test cases and continued with beta Responsive Web Design. I don't like how we're (to my knowledge) force to use [eval](https://stackoverflow.com/a/18269921/15329048) for this project.

- <time>Apr 14, 2022</time> Finished all the coding challenges for Advanced Node and Express. I didn't like the chat application part, mainly because the test cases were too lenient and you could pass a lot of them with a non-functional project. Anyways, I also continued with beta Responsive Web Design.

- <time>Mar 23, 2022</time> Dang it, I forgot about the tests that I had to write. This project is deceivingly big. Anyways, made a bit of progress on the project and continued with beta Responsive Web Design (also, [beta Relational Database](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/) looks really cool).

- <time>Mar 22, 2022</time> Sort of got multiple stocks to work (the query parameter if-else conditions aren't very good though), I think I can technically submit the project now, but it's obviously not complete (need to implement the like and rel_likes features)

- <time>Mar 21, 2022</time> Fixed an [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) glitch where it would take two refreshes to get the stock price. Got started with two stocks and continued with beta Responsive Web Design.

- <time>Mar 20, 2022</time> Progress on Stock Price Checker has been slow, why is it so hard to make a [GET request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/GET) in node.js?

- <time>Mar 19, 2022</time> Continued with the Stock Price Checker and Responsive Web Design.

Anyways, continued with beta Responsive Web Design and the [Information Security projects](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/information-security/#information-security-projects) look fun.

- <time>Mar 16, 2022</time> Continued with beta Responsive Web Design. Yeah, I know I've been skimping on Information Security. It'll come soon.

- <time>Mar 07, 2022</time> [This forum post](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/cant-add-more-than-one-exercise-in-mongodb-exercise-tracker/490874/3) should help with my glitch and continued with beta Responsive Web Design.

- <time>Mar 06, 2022</time> I think I know why my exercise tracker project's last test case doesn't pass, I can't save multiple exercises! I'll fix that soon and I've continued with beta Responsive Web Design.

- <time>Mar 05, 2022</time> The last test case was close to ending me so I opened up [a forum post](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/cannot-pass-the-last-test-case-for-exercise-tracker/499507) about it and continued with beta Responsive Web Design.

- <time>Feb 18, 2022</time> Started with [MongoDB and Mongoose](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/#mongodb-and-mongoose/) and finished a project in beta Responsive Web Design.

- <time>Feb 17, 2022</time> Finished Basic Node and Express, I think I finally got it down now.

- <time>Feb 16, 2022</time> Got started with [Basic Node and Express](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/#basic-node-and-express).

- <time>Feb 13, 2022</time> Well, I figured it out the treemap project [thanks to the D3 creator, Mike](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4063582). Just need to add the legend and the tooltip. Should be done in ~2 days.

- <time>Feb 12, 2022</time> Got started with the Treemap project and continue with beta Responsive Web Design.

- <time>Feb 11, 2022</time> Map done! Couldn't get the tooltip test cases to pass for some reason, but [here it is](https://codepen.io/y_arjun_y/full/PoOGzrO). I'll work on [the last project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-visualization/data-visualization-projects/visualize-data-with-a-treemap-diagram) tomorrow. Also continued with beta Responsive Web Design.

- <time>Feb 10, 2022</time> Only 3 more test cases left to pass! Also finished a project in beta Responsive Web Design.

- <time>Feb 09, 2022</time> LET'S GO I got the map all coloured in (the colour scheme is a little different, but that's fine), going to try to wrap this up in about 2 days.

- <time>Feb 08, 2022</time> Okay, colouring will be impossible if I don't use FCC's map data. Figuring out how to replace the pre-existing map data with that. Also continued with beta Responsive Web Design.

- <time>Feb 07, 2022</time> In the process of figuring out how to color in the map. Also continued with beta Responsive Web Design.

- <time>Feb 06, 2022</time> Figured out the map! Also continued with beta Responsive Web Design and finished a section within it!

- <time>Feb 05, 2022</time> Still figuring out the whole map thing, though [I think I found my answer](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/drawing-us-map-in-d3-chloropleth/481354). Also continued with beta Responsive Web Design.

- <time>Feb 04, 2022</time> Got started with the map project, wondering if I can use [a package](https://github.com/d3-node/choropleth-us-counties) to draw the US map instead of converting the data they gave into an [SVG](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG) (which is too complicated). Also continued with beta Responsive Web Design.

- <time>Feb 03, 2022</time> Finished with the heatmap project ([here's the link to it](https://codepen.io/y_arjun_y/full/MWOWMMQ))! Will start with [the penultimate project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-visualization/data-visualization-projects/visualize-data-with-a-choropleth-map) tomorrow. Also continued with beta Responsive Web Design.

- <time>Feb 02, 2022</time> So close to submitting my heatmap project, just need another day to make the y-axis show the month name, not the number and to add text below the legend (also, figured out the legend!) and I also continued with beta Responsive Web Design.

- <time>Feb 01, 2022</time> Got more than half of the test cases to pass, though I still need to figure out how to make a legend. Also continued with beta Responsive Web Design.

- <time>Jan 31, 2022</time> Made amazing progress! The heatmap is basically complete, just need to add a legend, fix the tooltip and pass the tests. I also continued with the beta Responsive Web Design.

- <time>Jan 30, 2022</time> Made good progress with the heatmap project, I got the axes set properly, it's just the squares that need work now. Also finished two projects within beta Responsive Web Design!

- <time>Jan 29, 2022</time> Sort of fixed the data issue with [this less obscure website](https://jsonbin.io) (I say sort of because the free account only has 10000 requests before it goes down, which is decent, but the tests that I run might exhaust that, not entirely sure) and continued with beta Responsive Web Design.

- <time>Jan 28, 2022</time> The same issue that came up with the bar chart project has come up again, I can't seem to find a place to store edited data. Since the FCC data is nested, it's really hard to work with, so I "unnested" it and stored it on this [obscure website](https://extendsclass.com/json-storage.html), but the data stored there doesn't seem to be permanent, so now I have to work on both my heatmap project and my bar chart project again.

  Oh, I also continued with beta Responsive Web Design.

- <time>Jan 27, 2022</time> Made a bit of progress on the heat map and continued with beta Responsive Web Design.

- <time>Jan 26, 2022</time> Finished the scatterplot project! Yeah, there are two test cases left, but they have the same issue as the bar chart project. [Here's the project](https://codepen.io/y_arjun_y/full/VwMQEMm). Also got started on [the Heat Map project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-visualization/data-visualization-projects/visualize-data-with-a-heat-map) and continued with beta Responsive Web Design.

- <time>Jan 25, 2022</time> Didn't have much time today, so I could only continue the beta Responsive Web Design.

- <time>Jan 24, 2022</time> Got done with the legend, the only tests I have left relate to the annoying D3 attributes.

- <time>Jan 23, 2022</time> Again made great progress, I only have 5 test cases left to pass for my scatterplot project and continued with beta Responsive Web Design.

- <time>Jan 22, 2022</time> Made amazing progress, got the whole y-axis done and added the circles for the scatterplot. Just need to get the test cases to pass.

- <time>Jan 21, 2022</time> Got the y-axis almost complete and continued with beta Responsive Web Design.

- <time>Jan 20, 2022</time> Couldn't continue with my scatterplot (will try to finish it in the weekend) but I continued with beta Responsive Web Design. Someone in an EA [Slack](https://slack.com/) channel talked about FCC!

- <time>Jan 19, 2022</time> For some reason, it's really complicated to get minute and second formatted time on a y-axis (like this: 31:24), will continue work on it tomorrow. Also continued with beta Responsive Web Design.

- <time>Jan 18, 2022</time> Got started with [the scatterplot project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-visualization/data-visualization-projects/visualize-data-with-a-scatterplot-graph) and continued with beta Responsive Web Design.

- <time>Jan 17, 2022</time> Couldn't fix that issue, but that's alright. Submitted my bar chart project! (see it [here](https://codepen.io/y_arjun_y/full/QWqKjdj)) and continued beta Responsive Web Design.

- <time>Jan 16, 2022</time> Got every test case to pass, except for one... I'll work on that tomorrow and if I can't get it, I'll just submit it. Anyways, I also continued beta Responsive Web Design.

- <time>Jan 15, 2022</time> Finished the tooltip, now I just need to pass all the test cases. Also continued the beta Responsive Web Design.

- <time>Jan 14, 2022</time> Partially added the logic for a tooltip in my bar chart project and continued with beta Responsive Web Design.

- <time>Jan 13, 2022</time> Continued with beta Responsive Web Design.

- <time>Jan 12, 2022</time> Got half of the test cases to pass for my project and continued beta Responsive Web Design.

- <time>Jan 11, 2022</time> Now I made some good progress, I decided to use [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) (as it was easier to store on the web) and everything except the tooltips is done.

- <time>Jan 10, 2022</time> Wasn't able to make much progress with my bar chart project as I wasted a lot of my time trying to figure out how to host my custom data file, anyways, I continued with beta Responsive Web Design.

- <time>Jan 09, 2022</time> Made good progress with [my bar chart project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-visualization/data-visualization-projects/visualize-data-with-a-bar-chart) (though the x-axis is fully destroyed) and continued with beta Responsive Web Design.

- <time>Jan 08, 2022</time> Continued with data visualization and the beta Responsive Web Design.

- <time>Jan 07, 2022</time> I'll update [the 25 + 5 Clock code](https://codepen.io/y_arjun_y/full/VwMQGvg) if any changes come up, but for now, [I've earned my Front End Development Libraries certificate!](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/arjunyadav/front-end-development-libraries) Will push on with data visualization tomorrow.

- <time>Jan 06, 2022</time> Finished the HTML part of beta Responsive Web Design and [opened up a forum post](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/unable-to-pass-many-user-stories-for-25-5-clock-even-though-they-should-all-pass/491388) about my issues with my project.

- <time>Jan 05, 2022</time> Continued with beta Responsive Web Design, still have ~6 test cases left even though I should pass them. This annoying script error bug has been there for almost 2 days.

- <time>Jan 04, 2022</time> Continued with beta Responsive Web Design, only 6 more test cases. Also, 100-day streak!

- <time>Jan 03, 2022</time> Continued with beta Responsive Web Design and I only have 8 more test cases to pass for my 25 + 5 clock!

- <time>Jan 02, 2022</time> Continued with beta Responsive Web Design and sort of made the timer functional, though there is some weird script error.

- <time>Jan 01, 2022</time> Continued with beta Responsive Web Design and made a breakthrough with my 25 + 5 project, I figured out that there should be two states for seconds, one for math and another to be displayed. Hopefully, I'll get this project complete and earn my certificate by the end of this week!

- <time>Dec 31, 2021</time> Continued with the beta version of Responsive Web Design and my 25 + 5 Clock project. Hope to get almost fully through FCC in 2022!

- <time>Dec 30, 2021</time> These front-end projects take so, so long. And if you take a few days to build them, your streak gets wrecked. So I was desperate, I was so tired from my [25 + 5 Clock project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-25--5-clock) that I started to do my data visualization projects, thinking they would be faster to do than the front-end projects (they weren't).

  But then, just as I was about to give up, I saw... [this](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/). This not only saved my streak for today, but my streak for years to come as I can speedrun this on the side and finish my projects without melting my brain by trying to do it all in one day.

  Thank you, whoever thought of this. (Side note: This is actually a cool idea on its own, I really dig the new design on these challenges.)

- <time>Oct 08, 2022</time> Got selected for the national level!

- <time>Oct 06, 2022</time> 5/6 in ~11 minutes. I've decided to pause this project. If I get selected to the national level, I'll continue this project, else it ends.

- <time>Jun 22, 2022</time> Daily puzzles went alright.

- <time>Jun 21, 2022</time> I just got through today's weekly challenge lol.

- <time>Jun 20, 2022</time> Oof, got the last 6x6 wrong because I forgot that the sum property of a 6x6 is 21.

- <time>Jun 19, 2022</time> All correct in the Weekly challenge in 8 minutes and 20 seconds. Need to get it down to 7 by the end of this month.

- <time>Jun 16, 2022</time> Sigh, 5/6.

- <time>Jun 15, 2022</time> Daily puzzles went well.

- <time>Jun 14, 2022</time> Could have gotten all correct in ~8 minutes if it wasn't for a silly mistake in the last 6x6.

- <time>Jun 13, 2022</time> Daily puzzles went okay.

- <time>Jun 12, 2022</time> Sigh, 4/6.

- <time>Jun 11, 2022</time> 5/6. It's both good and bad that I no longer find the hard 6x6s in the daily puzzles difficult.

- <time>Jun 10, 2022</time> All correct in ~5 minutes!

- <time>Jun 09, 2022</time> 5/6 in what felt like forever.

- <time>Jun 08, 2022</time> The website glitched out, so I got to do only one daily puzzle :(

- <time>Jun 07, 2022</time> Sigh. All 6x6s wrong.

- <time>Jun 06, 2022</time> Daily puzzles went okay.

- <time>Jun 05, 2022</time> ~9 minutes again... but with a 6x6 left wrong :(

- <time>Jun 04, 2022</time> ~9 minutes for the weekly challenge. I hope to stabilize to ~7 minutes soon enough.

- <time>Jun 03, 2022</time> Daily puzzles went pretty well.

- <time>Jun 02, 2022</time> Sigh. 11 minutes for 1 6x6 wrong.

- <time>Jun 01, 2022</time> Daily puzzles went well.

- <time>May 31, 2022</time> I somehow got two 5x5s wrong in today's weekly challenge. Should I slow down for 5x5s?

- <time>May 30, 2022</time> Daily puzzles were alright.

- <time>May 29, 2022</time> All correct in exactly 10 minutes lol.

- <time>May 28, 2022</time> Weekly challenge in ~8 minutes... with all the 6x6s wrong.

- <time>May 27, 2022</time> Daily puzzles were pretty bad.

- <time>May 26, 2022</time> All correct in ~7 minutes and 40 seconds in today's weekly challenge.

- <time>May 25, 2022</time> Daily puzzles were okay.

- <time>May 24, 2022</time> All correct in less than 7 minutes in today's weekly challenge!

- <time>May 23, 2022</time> Daily puzzles were alright.

- <time>May 22, 2022</time> Tragic, got the 5x5 wrong but the rest were correct in ~7 minutes :/

- <time>May 21, 2022</time> I DID IT! Just under 6 minutes for all correct in the weekly challenge!

- <time>May 20, 2022</time> Sigh, 8 minutes for the last 6x6 left incomplete.

- <time>May 19, 2022</time> Worst weekly challenge ever: ~8 minutes for three wrong (2 wrong, 1 left unattempted) :(

- <time>May 18, 2022</time> Daily puzzles were meh to alright.

- <time>May 17, 2022</time> Weekly challenge went so poorly (5/6 in more than 10 minutes) :(

- <time>May 16, 2022</time> Daily puzzles were meh.

- <time>May 15, 2022</time> Getting sort of close to the 7 minute mark with the weekly challenges!

- <time>May 14, 2022</time> Same issue, below 10 minutes but left one puzzle as wrong for that (to make matters worse, it was a 5x5).

- <time>May 13, 2022</time> Daily puzzles were alright.

- <time>May 12, 2022</time> ~9 minutes with the last 6x6 incorrect :(

- <time>May 11, 2022</time> ~7 minutes with all correct in the bonus challenge!

- <time>May 10, 2022</time> Weekly challenge took ~10 minutes but with the last 6x6 was incorrect.

- <time>May 09, 2022</time> Daily puzzles were pretty good!

- <time>May 08, 2022</time> Got below 9 minutes in the weekly challenge with all correct!

- <time>May 07, 2022</time> Got all correct in the weekly challenge... in ~14 minutes :(

- <time>May 06, 2022</time> Daily puzzles were meh.

- <time>May 05, 2022</time> Another weekly challenge in 9 minutes, but... I had to leave a 6x6 as incorrect for that :(

- <time>May 04, 2022</time> Daily puzzles were terrible lol.

- <time>May 03, 2022</time> I DID IT! All correct in ~9 minutes! Now I need to do all of it in 7 minutes...

- <time>May 02, 2022</time> Daily puzzles were not bad.

- <time>May 01, 2022</time> Not sure what the exact medical term is, but "the physiological feeling of having no time left in an exam/competitive setting" happened in today's weekly challenge lol. I had ~2 minutes left to reach my goal of completing a weekly challenge in 10 minutes or less and I did it... but all of the 6x6s were wrong. :(

- <time>Apr 30, 2022</time> Weekly challenge was pretty poor (one wrong in 14 minutes) and daily puzzles were half-way decent.

- <time>Apr 29, 2022</time> Daily puzzles went really well for a change.

- <time>Apr 28, 2022</time> Bad day KENKEN-wise, took ~14 minutes for all correct and daily puzzles were pretty bad.

- <time>Apr 27, 2022</time> I've noticed that with hard 6x6 puzzles, I need to often make strenuous guesses or YOLO my way out of it. Sigh.

- <time>Apr 26, 2022</time> Sigh, I was about to finish the weekly challenge in about 10 minutes, but the last 6x6 tripped me up.

- <time>Apr 25, 2022</time> I need to stop using the check button every time I put something down.

- <time>Apr 24, 2022</time> Finished the weekly challenge in under 10 minutes BUT I had to basically skip the last 6x6 for that to happen.

- <time>Apr 23, 2022</time> Not bad, a little more than 10 and a half minutes with all correct for today's weekly challenge (I miraculously got the last 6x6 correct lol).

- <time>Apr 22, 2022</time> Daily puzzles went alright.

- <time>Apr 21, 2022</time> Similar story, ~16-17 minutes but all correct (the first 6x6 was pretty darn hard).

- <time>Apr 20, 2022</time> Even worse, went down to 16 minutes with 1 wrong.

- <time>Apr 19, 2022</time> Dropped down to 15 minutes for the weekly challenge :(

- <time>Apr 18, 2022</time> Daily puzzles went meh.

- <time>Apr 17, 2022</time> Got another one below 10 minutes, though this time it took 9 minutes and 46 seconds (all correct) and the daily puzzles went a bit better.

- <time>Apr 16, 2022</time> Got below 10 minutes on the weekly challenge! (~9 and a half minutes with all correct) and daily puzzles are still meh (I even got one wrong).

- <time>Apr 15, 2022</time> Daily puzzles went laughably bad.

- <time>Apr 14, 2022</time> Weekly challenge (all correct in 12 minutes) and daily puzzles went meh, I hope to get below 10 minutes on the weekly challenge next week.

- <time>Apr 13, 2022</time> Daily puzzles went well.

- <time>Apr 12, 2022</time> Finished the weekly challenge in 11 minutes this time around and finished 2 hard 6x6s.

- <time>Apr 11, 2022</time> Bonus challenge took almost 20 minutes and I couldn't do a second hard 6x6 :(

- <time>Apr 10, 2022</time> Still took more than 10 minutes but got all correct this time. Bonus challenge will be done tomorrow!

- <time>Apr 09, 2022</time> Weekly challenge (5/6) took more than 10 minutes (I don't remember the exact time). Need to bring it down to less than 10 minutes consistently.

- <time>Apr 08, 2022</time> Daily puzzles were decent, I'm really happy at my progress at hard 6x6s.

- <time>Apr 07, 2022</time> Barely got through the weekly challenge in 10 minutes (closer to 11 actually but whatever).

- <time>Apr 06, 2022</time> Daily puzzles went alright.

- <time>Apr 05, 2022</time> Haha, they changed the weekly challenge to four 5x5s and two 6x6s (in the order), finished that with all correct in 15 minutes (which is bad, but it's my first try at it so it's alright) and the first hard 6x6 I did took me 10 minutes lol.

- <time>Apr 04, 2022</time> When solving hard puzzles, your main goal isn't to find the correct position of the numbers right away, but rather you need the fuel: this could be from the row-column sum property, just some simple logic (a +12 cell in a 6x6 always has to contain a 5 and two number that add up to seven), anything really. After that, it's a piece of π.

- <time>Apr 03, 2022</time> 6/6 in 4 and a half minutes! The two hard 6x6s went alright, though I did take a lot of time for both of them.

- <time>Apr 02, 2022</time> Finished weekly challenge (5/6 in 10-ish minutes) and I think I'm ready for hard 6x6s now.

- <time>Apr 01, 2022</time> Daily puzzles went meh.

- <time>Mar 31, 2022</time> Why do I keep blundering a puzzle in the weekly challenge? Also, when will I comfortably transition to hard 6x6s, when will my weekly challenges update? So many questions.

- <time>Mar 30, 2022</time> Daily puzzles went meh, I really hope they update our weekly challenges for the next level puzzles (since I'll be getting 6x6s not 4x4s)

- <time>Mar 29, 2022</time> Made it to the next level (I somehow got the first 4x4 wrong in the school level exam) and got all correct in the weekly challenge today and the daily puzzles went okay.

- <time>Mar 28, 2022</time> For some reason, only one daily puzzle was unlocked, but it went well (one medium 6x6).

- <time>Mar 27, 2022</time> Daily puzzles (two medium 6x6s) went alright.

- <time>Mar 26, 2022</time> Slightly better, 5/6.

- <time>Mar 25, 2022</time> Got 4/6 in my last weekly challenge for this week.

- <time>Mar 24, 2022</time> New PB: Weekly challenge completed in less than 4 minutes, why couldn't have the school exam gone like this?

- <time>Mar 23, 2022</time> No weekly challenge today, but the daily puzzles (two medium 6x6s) went alright.

- <time>Mar 22, 2022</time> Sigh, got 4/6 in the weekly challenge and the daily puzzles (two medium 6x6s) went really poorly.

- <time>Mar 21, 2022</time> Both the bonus weekly challenge (5/6 in about 11 minutes) and the daily puzzles went poorly.

- <time>Mar 20, 2022</time> Finished with the weekly challenge and the daily puzzles, will complete the bonus challenge tomorrow.

- <time>Mar 19, 2022</time> Had my school-level exam. It went pretty terribly (most likely all correct in about 10 minutes) but it's very likely I proceed to the next level. Also finished weekly challenge and daily puzzles.

- <time>Mar 18, 2022</time> Finished with the daily puzzles, went really well.

- <time>Mar 17, 2022</time> Found something interesting in my weekly challenge (which went meh) and my daily puzzles: Notice the below image and the "108x" cage:

<img src="/interesting-kenken.png" alt="Half of an interesting 6x6 KENKEN puzzle" height="350px" />

Now, there is only one possibility which is "3 x 6 x 6 x 1", but what about the position? We can use the fact that 1 has to be on the top row of the cage to our advantage and see that that there are only two possibilities left:

<img src="/interesting-kenken-1.png" alt="Half of an interesting 6x6 KENKEN puzzle" height="350px" />

<img src="/interesting-kenken-2.png" alt="Half of an interesting 6x6 KENKEN puzzle" height="350px" />

But regardless of which possibility is correct, **3 and 6 are always in the bottom row!** So, that leaves 4 in the "9+" cage. Thought it was interesting.

- <time>Mar 16, 2022</time> Back to medium 6x6s.

- <time>Mar 15, 2022</time> Weekly challenge (one wrong in about 10 minutes) and daily puzzles (had to drop back to easy 6x6s) went bad.

- <time>Mar 14, 2022</time> Happy Pi Day, I don't think I'm ready for two hard 6x6s. I mean, I didn't check my medium 6x6 (being overconfident) and got it wrong lol.

- <time>Mar 13, 2022</time> Both the weekly challenge (all correct in > 8 minutes) and daily puzzles went badly. At least I have a bonus challenge for [Pi Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi_Day).

- <time>Mar 12, 2022</time> Finished the last weekly challenge for this week (doesn't make sense, I know) in 6 and a half minutes. The first hard 6x6 was good but it took a long time to find the second one.

- <time>Mar 11, 2022</time> Going to start doing 2 hard 6x6s for my daily puzzles instead of one medium and one hard.

- <time>Mar 10, 2022</time> Finished the weekly challenge (all correct in ~5-6 minutes) and finished a medium and a hard 6x6 (again, went poorly today).

- <time>Mar 09, 2022</time> Finished a medium 6x6 in ~3 minutes but the hard 6x6 went pretty poorly today.

- <time>Mar 08, 2022</time> Not bad, got done with the weekly challenge (all correct in about 6 minutes) and finished a medium, and a hard 6x6 in ~3 minutes each.

- <time>Mar 07, 2022</time> Finished a medium, 6x6 in less than 2 minutes! Hard 6x6 went pretty well too.

- <time>Mar 06, 2022</time> Finally, the weekly challenge went well (all correct in just shy of 6 minutes) and finished a medium and hard 6x6.

- <time>Mar 05, 2022</time> Finished with the weekly challenge (was going amazingly well until I couldn't solve a dumb 5x5, still did 5/6 in 6 and a half minutes) and finished with one medium 6x6 and a hard 6x6.

- <time>Mar 04, 2022</time> I've started doing one medium 6x6 and one hard 6x6. The hard one takes ~4 minutes so my goal is to get that down to 2 minutes.

- <time>Mar 03, 2022</time> Getting better at 6x6 and today's weekly challenge was meh (one wrong in ~8 minutes)

- <time>Mar 02, 2022</time> Finished with two medium 6x6s, they went fine.

- <time>Mar 01, 2022</time> Weekly challenge was going smoothly till one 5x5 messed up my time. I took a little more than 10 minutes and couldn't get the last one. :(

- <time>Feb 28, 2022</time> Medium 6x6 takes too much time and an easy 6x6 takes too little time to solve!

- <time>Feb 27, 2022</time> Finished the weekly challenge (~10 minutes, all correct) and two medium 6x6. I have this bad habit with my daily puzzles of hitting the "Check" button, so I hit it for the last puzzle and saw I got most cells flipped (i.e. wrong). Ouch.

- <time>Feb 26, 2022</time> Finished the weekly challenge (went meh, ~10 minutes and got one wrong) and a medium and hard 6x6 (the hard one took a long time).

- <time>Feb 25, 2022</time> Finished a hard and medium 6x6 after a lot of cherry-picking lol.

- <time>Feb 24, 2022</time> Solid day, finished the weekly challenge in less than 10 minutes and finished a medium 6x6 and a hard 6x6.

- <time>Feb 23, 2022</time> Finished one medium and one hard 6x6 with all operations! (though they took a long time)

- <time>Feb 22, 2022</time> Can now solve an easy 6x6 with all operations in a little under 3 minutes! Also, today's weekly challenge went alright (all correct but in 10 minutes, got stuck with a puzzle).

- <time>Feb 21, 2022</time> Finished with two puzzles, including a medium 6x6 (with + and -) in only 2 and a half minutes!

- <time>Feb 20, 2022</time> Pretty slow throughout my two weekly challenges (one of them was a bonus and I got one wrong) and my daily puzzles. At least I started with addition and subtraction for 6x6!

- <time>Feb 19, 2022</time> Amazing day! Beat my record (all correct in 5 minutes and 12 seconds) and moved up to easy (not easiest/very easy) 6x6 with only addition.

- <time>Feb 18, 2022</time> No weekly challenge today but I finished a hard 5x5 and a very easy 6x6 (improving in time quite a bit).

- <time>Feb 17, 2022</time> Finished a hard 5x5 and a very easy 6x6 (which took way too long lol) and I think I hit a new record for the weekly challenge, all correct in 5 minutes and 59 seconds!

- <time>Feb 16, 2022</time> Finished two hard 5x5s, going to start doing one 6x6 (starting with all operations + easiest and working my way up) and one hard 5x5 since all the stages above school level have two 6x6s for my category!

- <time>Feb 15, 2022</time> Finished with 5/6 again and (for fun) I did an easy 6x6 (with only addition) and the usual hard 5x5 (both took roughly the same amount of time!)

- <time>Feb 14, 2022</time> Not bad, 5/6 again and finished the two hard 5x5s quite quickly.

- <time>Feb 13, 2022</time> Solid day, 5/6 in the weekly challenge and finished the two hard 5x5s.

- <time>Feb 12, 2022</time> Alright day, finished the two weekly challenges remaining for this week (6/6 in the first one, 4/6 in the other, both times I used a decent amount of time) and finished my two hard 5x5s for the day.

- <time>Feb 11, 2022</time> Nice! A new record, all puzzles correct in only ~6 minutes! Also got both my hard 5x5's done in less than 2 minutes. I already feel ready for the exam.

- <time>Feb 10, 2022</time> Solved the weekly challenge in only 8 minutes! (it also wrongly marked my first 4x4 as incorrect, weird) and I finished one hard 5x5 (blocked me from doing a second one, weird).

- <time>Feb 09, 2022</time> Got done with the last Jan weekly challenge (4/6, pretty meh) and finished two hard 5x5's (last one took a long time).

- <time>Feb 08, 2022</time> Alright day, finished a weekly challenge (5 out of 6) and 2 hard 5x5's (though the last one I had to rely on the check tool a lot).

- <time>Feb 07, 2022</time> Finished a weekly challenge (all correct, used a little more than half the time) and 2 hard 5x5's (all correct).

- <time>Feb 06, 2022</time> Going to finish the early-Jan weekly challenge I missed.

- <time>Feb 05, 2022</time> Awesome day KENKEN-wise, got full on the weekly challenge with 13 minutes to spare and finished two hard 5x5s.

- <time>Feb 04, 2022</time> Very similar to yesterday, finished the weekly challenge (5 out of 6 with exactly 15 minutes left) and the daily puzzles (got the hard 5x5 wrong).

- <time>Feb 03, 2022</time> Finished the weekly challenge (it was alright, 5 out of 6 with about 17 minutes left) and the daily puzzles.

- <time>Feb 02, 2022</time> Not bad, finished both my daily puzzles (though I took a long time).

- <time>Feb 01, 2022</time> Awesome progress! I got done with my two daily puzzles (all correct) and finished with weekly challenge 2 (which I completed in about half the time with all correct!)

- <time>Jan 31, 2022</time> I still got it! A medium-level 4x4 takes me less than a minute, though 5x5's I still have to work on.

- <time>Jan 30, 2022</time> Registered for this year's edition after taking a break in 2021, I'll be getting 2 4x4's and 4 5x5's. Let's see how this project will go!

- <time>May 18, 2022</time> Again, had some fun with antichess (or Antichess?) ([1](https://lichess.org/auEtS0Q2DpGt), [2](https://lichess.org/C8tsL3q2/))

- <time>May 17, 2022</time> Took me forever to checkmate with just a king and a queen, [but I did it](https://lichess.org/GE1wmusO)! (overall, with 1 takeback)

- <time>May 16, 2022</time> [A pretty humiliating defeat](https://lichess.org/YnThdAwC1whT).

- <time>May 15, 2022</time> [So close, yet so far](https://lichess.org/ikwCysD1/).

- <time>May 12, 2022</time> [I stupidly stalemated after ~6 takebacks](https://lichess.org/mHdsSRo3).

- <time>May 10, 2022</time> [Drew Stockfish Level 4](https://lichess.org/2lojjiiC) with (very roughly) 15 takebacks.

- <time>May 09, 2022</time> For some fun, I played an [Antichess](https://lichess.org/nq1ouE5CMjYS) and a [Chess960](https://lichess.org/E2RAI2Lm8qFN) game.

- <time>May 08, 2022</time> [I liked this game a lot](https://lichess.org/VZNkBq9SqGQT) (even though I lost).

- <time>May 07, 2022</time> [Went back to Level 3 for a game](https://lichess.org/Sjw5zGaS).

- <time>May 06, 2022</time> [Oof](https://lichess.org/ubDbzVToEEN8).

- <time>May 05, 2022</time> [I thought I played well in this game](https://lichess.org/ucqFj9yk/). Nope, 11 blunders (I also missed such an obvious check that could have potentially won the game).

- <time>May 04, 2022</time> [Another win](https://lichess.org/fih99502)! (though I did takeback once)

- <time>May 03, 2022</time> I got checkmated 3 times... ([1](https://lichess.org/vXVawh68BJmO), [2](https://lichess.org/HhSS3DsT1Rbx), [3](https://lichess.org/naFAOqR61XJP))
- <time>May 02, 2022</time> [Back to being bad at chess](https://lichess.org/GSmnChPu).

- <time>May 01, 2022</time> What a way to start off the month: [defeated Stockfish Level 4 without takebacks with the black pieces](https://lichess.org/3NcHqVM1/) (only 1 blunder from my side!)

- <time>Apr 30, 2022</time> [That is certainly one way to end of the month](https://lichess.org/zNJYBuZj/).

- <time>Apr 29, 2022</time> Two checkmates for the price of one: [1](https://lichess.org/Kke677aa0wul), [2](https://lichess.org/E9SB0eHPTbn2).

- <time>Apr 28, 2022</time> [Stalemate after some takebacks](https://lichess.org/ssTgvmXno5Xz).

- <time>Apr 27, 2022</time> [Played a blitz game against my friend](https://lichess.org/xJwvwn5y).

- <time>Apr 26, 2022</time> [One of my shortest game ever](https://lichess.org/hsw1Ahwq) (also [drew Level 4 after a couple of takebacks](https://lichess.org/DOp6uGXV)).

- <time>Apr 24, 2022</time> [I went from 3 pawns up to checkmate in like 15 moves](https://lichess.org/eScmA5Gt/) :(

- <time>Apr 23, 2022</time> [Sigh](https://lichess.org/h8l6S4dz).

- <time>Apr 22, 2022</time> [Rough game](https://lichess.org/b98zhIeb).

- <time>Apr 21, 2022</time> I think I need to go back to Level 3.

- <time>Apr 20, 2022</time> [Definitely doesn't count but still a fun game](https://lichess.org/L5E379tJ).

- <time>Apr 19, 2022</time> [Only ~2 takebacks this time](https://lichess.org/uv5bB7OP)!

- <time>Apr 18, 2022</time> [I won using the Tennison Gambit!](https://lichess.org/3hVwF3GxP5xS) (note: this doesn't count towards my battle against Stockfish Level 4 lol)

- <time>Apr 17, 2022</time> [Sigh](https://lichess.org/nCWfEusDxGRY).

- <time>Apr 16, 2022</time> [I think this one counts](https://lichess.org/mIHX8ii514Sz), I did takeback once but it was accidental.

- <time>Apr 15, 2022</time> [Another game that doesn't really count because of takebacks](https://lichess.org/DwmZrFAH).

- <time>Apr 14, 2022</time> [The uphill battle against Stockfish Level 4 is going to be a long one...](https://lichess.org/mDhrPoHpjsFE)

- <time>Apr 13, 2022</time> [This WOULD have been my first win against Stockfish Level 4](https://lichess.org/anOmMF1T) if I hadn't taken back so many times in the endgame (still a fun game!)

- <time>Apr 12, 2022</time> [Nice](https://lichess.org/YkoW8FUw).

- <time>Apr 11, 2022</time> [With one take back, I got my revenge against Stockfish.](https://lichess.org/UVSVtH9k/)

- <time>Apr 10, 2022</time> Sigh. ([1](https://lichess.org/HDJrnGzmtZw1), [2](https://lichess.org/dZp9iTRN5Nac))

- <time>Apr 09, 2022</time> Played sort of absent-mindedly but here we are: [1](https://lichess.org/qtWsajtnYHld), [2](https://lichess.org/tep1fr7y9Ej0).

- <time>Apr 08, 2022</time> [Sigh](https://lichess.org/hfP10Qiry8FK).

- <time>Apr 07, 2022</time> [Ouch](https://lichess.org/auFUm9pP), I don't think there were any good moves at move 15 lol.

- <time>Apr 06, 2022</time> [Possibly the wildest game I've ever played](https://lichess.org/QMhUWQ2Y). I was so close to losing and then I pulled up with the promotion that made me win with the black pieces!

- <time>Apr 05, 2022</time> [I need to practice with the black pieces](https://lichess.org/AFzchdPIX70b) against Stockfish Level 3. [I'm fine with the white pieces](https://lichess.org/5WWgfcxNo3lC).

- <time>Apr 04, 2022</time> [Maybe a simple 1. e4 with good opening principles and development is all you need at this level](https://lichess.org/dPXpnyW2wv3E).

- <time>Apr 03, 2022</time> No idea what I did today for chess today. I need to change my opening repertoire.

- <time>Apr 02, 2022</time> I present to you, [the biggest throw ever](https://lichess.org/IisosILB).

- <time>Apr 01, 2022</time> [I feel like Stockfish wanted to throw an April Fools' Day joke at me...](https://lichess.org/YNk1DPtz)

- <time>Mar 31, 2022</time> [Sigh](https://lichess.org/Uw3QuLpa).

- <time>Mar 30, 2022</time> [I threw this game so badly lol](https://lichess.org/Zq3UitfH).

- <time>Mar 29, 2022</time> Man, [I really lost my luck with the King's Indian Attack](https://lichess.org/vk4ykawkKQ9I).

- <time>Mar 28, 2022</time> Not sure what I was doing today.

- <time>Mar 27, 2022</time> [Stockfish Level 4 made me suffer in the last few moves](https://lichess.org/Wnc5FazT). We quickly went from the best game yet to possibly the worst game yet lol.

- <time>Mar 26, 2022</time> [My best game yet with the King's Indian Setup](https://lichess.org/wBuMt14Y), no blunders and I never lost the advantage + didn't lose a forced checkmate sequence lol. Played a few other King's Indian Setups as well ([1](https://lichess.org/kNel3RsmqMzZ), [2](https://lichess.org/CTYOZMYD43bT))

- <time>Mar 24, 2022</time> [I threw away a game so badly](https://lichess.org/J5UWKcCf) that I'm actually disappointed in myself. At least the King's Indian Setup has proven its worth to me with the white pieces.

- <time>Mar 23, 2022</time> I think this will be my opening repertoire: black pieces with e4 will be the Caro-Kann Defense and anything else (white or black pieces) will mean the [King's Indian Setup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kK0cq6UBt1Y) (need to study this one).

- <time>Mar 22, 2022</time> [This game definitely doesn't count](https://lichess.org/I9LuxSgMDNQq) (took back a lot of blunders) but it was so calming to checkmate my opponent with three queens while listening to Pentatonic.

- <time>Mar 21, 2022</time> [Explored the Blackmar-Diemer Gambit](https://lichess.org/Xc9lFTBf) (also this game doesn't count as a win because I used so many takebacks lol)

- <time>Mar 20, 2022</time> [Explored Stockfish Level 4 with many takebacks](https://lichess.org/ONdJj5ni).

- <time>Mar 19, 2022</time> Never mind. ([1](https://lichess.org/SpRBdlSncvt3), [2](https://lichess.org/q8ZmSMxcg74v))
- <time>Mar 18, 2022</time> [Time to move on to Level 4?](https://lichess.org/uPYtO4TB/white#107)

- <time>Mar 17, 2022</time> I was trying out the [Italian Game](https://www.chess.com/openings/Italian-Game) and [I got this gem of a game](https://lichess.org/YD5Pn3BV/), so I guess my opening with the white pieces is now the Italian Game? Need to study it for some time.

- <time>Mar 16, 2022</time> [Had no clue what I was doing with the London System](https://lichess.org/8bDyoPeDvpO4).

- <time>Mar 15, 2022</time> [Saddest game yet?](https://lichess.org/ZmFrvgiAxmp5)

- <time>Mar 14, 2022</time> [My best worst game ever](https://lichess.org/fq9QmZ1Sw5Ch). I thought I was being smart with the pawn promotion sacrifice but nope.

- <time>Mar 13, 2022</time> Haha! [Pawn to knight promotion leads to checkmate](https://lichess.org/JegQsvaRNl86) (Note: I did do a couple of take backs).

- <time>Mar 12, 2022</time> Yeah, that game didn't go too well... Also played a few random games against bots for fun.

- <time>Mar 11, 2022</time> Started learning the [Giuoco Piano](https://www.chess.com/article/view/giuoco-piano-chess-opening) opening and [I got pretty far with it against Stockfish Level 3](https://lichess.org/SapRQi1L).

- <time>Mar 10, 2022</time> [Lost against my classmate after exchange variation](https://lichess.org/HAQ06c9b/). I thought move 22 was sort of smart but nope it was a blunder lol.

- <time>Mar 09, 2022</time> [This is most definitely the best game I've ever played so far](https://lichess.org/CqVRzsEy). Only one blunder with the Caro-Kann exchange variation and man was the endgame fun.

- <time>Mar 08, 2022</time> [What a game](https://lichess.org/RaKOMjdW).

- <time>Mar 07, 2022</time> Just sort of fooled around a bit. Second game wasn't too horrible (but I had no idea how to continue), [1](https://lichess.org/OtB1RmQBwona), [2](https://lichess.org/j6nnPFlM).

- <time>Mar 06, 2022</time> [Stockfish Level 2](https://lichess.org/9I8onA5B) is too easy and level 3 is too "meh" (can sometimes win if I'm focused) and I've noticed that very low rated bots just give up their queens sometimes.

- <time>Mar 05, 2022</time> [Resigned after losing my queen](https://lichess.org/O1I8KDut), though I performed a "push" variation of the Caro-Kann without referring back to the video!

- <time>Mar 04, 2022</time> Lost that game and played my [most humiliating game yet](https://lichess.org/bWdVW8XW).

- <time>Mar 03, 2022</time> [Started an interesting exchange variation](https://lichess.org/5xod7PlS), I have no idea where to go from here.

- <time>Nov 10, 2021</time> I think I will put the bots on the side and try to actually study the game instead of brute-forcing it.

- <time>Nov 09, 2021</time> Same old, same old. I also had some fun [analyzing games](https://chess.com/analysis) and [learning the Caro-Kann](https://www.chess.com/openings/Caro-Kann-Defense). Later, I won against my dad with the black pieces via checkmate.

[Here's the game](https://www.chess.com/analysis?pgn=%5BEvent%20%22vs%20Computer%22%5D%0A%5BSite%20%22Chess.com%22%5D%0A%5BDate%20%222021.11.03%22%5D%0A%5BRound%20%22?%22%5D%0A%5BWhite%20%22Pumpkin%22%5D%0A%5BBlack%20%22arjunyadav7%22%5D%0A%5BResult%20%220-1%22%5D%0A%5BBlackElo%20%22744%22%5D%0A%5BWhiteElo%20%221000%22%5D%0A%5BTimeControl%20%22-%22%5D%0A%0A1.%20Nc3%20e5%202.%20Ne4%20d5%203.%20Nc3%20c6%204.%20b3%20Nf6%205.%20Bb2%20Bc5%206.%20a3%20O-O%207.%20f3%20e4%208.%20f4%20h6%0A9.%20e3%20g5%2010.%20g3%20Bg4%2011.%20Nce2%20a5%2012.%20f5%20Nh5%2013.%20c4%20Bxf5%2014.%20b4%20axb4%2015.%20Kf2%20dxc4%0A16.%20Bg2%20bxa3%2017.%20Be5%20Nd7%2018.%20Bc3%20Nb6%2019.%20Nh3%20Na4%2020.%20Nd4%20Nxc3%2021.%20dxc3%20a2%2022.%0AQg1%20Ra3%2023.%20Qe1%20Qa5%2024.%20Rc1%20g4%2025.%20Ng5%20hxg5%2026.%20Rf1%20b5%2027.%20Nxf5%20Re8%2028.%20Bh1%20Re5%0A29.%20Kg2%20Kh7%2030.%20Kg1%20Kg6%2031.%20Nd4%20Bxd4%2032.%20Rd1%20Bxc3%2033.%20Qe2%20Kh6%2034.%20Rd6%2B%20Kg7%2035.%0ARa1%20Bxa1%2036.%20Kg2%20Rb3%2037.%20Rd7%20c3%2038.%20Kf2%20Rb2%2039.%20Rd1%20Rxe2%2B%2040.%20Kxe2%20c2%2041.%20Rxa1%0AQc3%2042.%20Bg2%20Qxa1%2043.%20Kd2%20c1%3DQ%2B%2044.%20Ke2%20Qc2%23%200-1&tab=analysis&referrer=vs-computer-analyze). I also resigned against Sven again.

- <time>Nov 02, 2021</time> So close, but I hanged my queen accidentally.

- <time>Nov 01, 2021</time> I hate pumpkins. (Also, [I completed a lesson on rook checkmates.](https://www.chess.com/lessons/winning-the-game))

- <time>Oct 31, 2021</time> Resigned against Sven for the quadrillionth time.

- <time>Oct 30, 2021</time> Tried to defeat the damn [Pumpkin](https://chess.com/play/computer), was close but blundered the endgame.

- <time>Oct 29, 2021</time> Kept resigning against Sven. Later in the day, I learnt about the [Scandinavian Defense](https://www.chess.com/openings/Scandinavian-Defense) and won against my dad with the white pieces via checkmate!

- <time>Oct 28, 2021</time> Kept resigning against [Sven](https://chess.com/play/computer) and [finished the Assisted Checkmate lesson](https://www.chess.com/lessons/winning-the-game/assisted-checkmates).

- <time>Jul 28, 2022</time> Practiced a sliding power chord song that was recommended to us (why do almost all of them have iffy names?)

- <time>Jul 08, 2022</time> Finished [a short video](https://www.justinguitar.com/guitar-lessons/awesome-power-chord-songs-bg-1207) in the module. I guess I've been less motivated to continue with this module since it's so electric guitar focused (though maybe I'm wrong and my skill is to blame here, not the acoustic)

- <time>Jul 04, 2022</time> Sort of continued with the riff.

- <time>Jul 03, 2022</time> Learnt the first part of the first part of the [Enter Sandman riff](https://www.justinguitar.com/guitar-lessons/enter-sandman-bg-1205).

- <time>May 23, 2022</time> Finished [some ear training](https://www.justinguitar.com/guitar-lessons/re-active-listening-bg-1104), felt pretty disheartened after getting the last exercise wrong.

- <time>May 22, 2022</time> Had fun with [this lesson](https://www.justinguitar.com/guitar-lessons/chord-freedom-bg-1101).

- <time>May 19, 2022</time> It took roughly a week but I can finally play Happy Birthday on my own!

- <time>May 18, 2022</time> Hopefully I should be able to play it tomorrow...

- <time>May 16, 2022</time> So close to playing Happy Birthday on my own!

- <time>May 15, 2022</time> Continued with learning Happy Birthday, about two-thirds of the way there.

- <time>May 13, 2022</time> Continued with learning Happy Birthday.

- <time>May 12, 2022</time> Got started with learning [Happy Birthday](https://www.justinguitar.com/guitar-lessons/happy-birthday-finger-style-bg-1106) and had some fun with learning [All Falls Down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWxt9GAiKZo) (I guess I've learnt it? It sounds pretty bad though).

- <time>May 10, 2022</time> Had fun playing How Much A Dollar Cost with [these chords](https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/tab/kendrick-lamar/how-much-a-dollar-cost-chords-1947283) (simplified) (only the F#, F and Dm sounded okay lol)

- <time>May 09, 2022</time> Finished with [shifting the F chord](https://www.justinguitar.com/guitar-lessons/shifting-the-f-bg-1103). The way Justin played the F chord reminded me [How Much a Dollar Cost by Kendrick Lamar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8kEiL81_R4). I'm going to try to play that tomorrow.

- <time>May 08, 2022</time> Got started with [Module 11 with some sus chords](https://www.justinguitar.com/guitar-lessons/beginner-sus-chords-bg-1102), I really like the transition from A sus2 to A sus4.

- <time>May 02, 2022</time> Got started with the second iteration of Module 10 practice.

- <time>May 01, 2022</time> Finished with the first iteration of Module 10 practice! Also, small correction: I don't use the songbook tab on JustinGuitar.com (since it forces the song into three categories, which I don't like) and instead I just like the play-through video (which acts as a songbook).

- <time>Apr 27, 2022</time> Continued with Module 10 practice and added two songs to my songbook!

- <time>Apr 26, 2022</time> Continued with Module 10 practice, F (with bar) chord is shaping up to be pretty decent now (similar sounding to a Fmaj7) but the change from F to C is slow for me lol.

- <time>Apr 23, 2022</time> Continued with Module 10 practice and did some really bad C Major improvisation (why did I choose the thinnest string?)

- <time>Apr 22, 2022</time> Continued (?) with Module 10 practice.

- <time>Apr 20, 2022</time> Finished with the Module 10 videos and got started with the first iteration of Module 10 practice (sort of, I need to start over with the C major scale alternate picking).

- <time>Apr 16, 2022</time> Finished with [Beginner Hammer-ons](https://www.justinguitar.com/guitar-lessons/beginner-hammer-ons-bg-1008) which are super tricky and learnt the single note variation of the [La Bamba riff](https://www.justinguitar.com/guitar-lessons/la-bamba-riff-bg-1009), which is super awesome.

- <time>Apr 15, 2022</time> Finished with [The Rhythm Push](https://www.justinguitar.com/guitar-lessons/the-rhythm-push-bg-1007) and also discovered that the 11th fret of the thinnest string sounds almost exactly like the "siren" sample in [Use This Gospel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yQVcGkbpAc).

- <time>Apr 14, 2022</time> Finished with [Alternate Picking C Major](https://www.justinguitar.com/guitar-lessons/alternate-picking-c-major-bg-1005) and [Major Scale Improvisation](https://www.justinguitar.com/guitar-lessons/major-scale-improvisation-bg-1006) (really excited to start guitar improv in this module's practice!)

- <time>Mar 20, 2022</time> Got my guitar strings replaced, I've never heard a guitar so out of tune before lol.

- <time>Mar 11, 2022</time> It wouldn't be a JustinGuitar module without an [odd finger training exercise](https://www.justinguitar.com/guitar-lessons/pinky-workout-b2-907). I was planning on finishing up [the Red Hot Chili Peppers riff today](https://www.justinguitar.com/guitar-lessons/californication-riff-b2-908) (since it's pretty easy) but my D string broke :(

- <time>Mar 08, 2022</time> Changed my mind, [the C Major scale](https://www.justinguitar.com/guitar-lessons/c-major-scale-b2-905) got to me lol. I'll start the chord book work tomorrow.

- <time>Mar 06, 2022</time> Finished with learning the F chord and [its variations](https://www.justinguitar.com/guitar-lessons/f-chord-cheats-b2-902). It honestly isn't _impossible_ but it certainly is tricky. Maybe I'm just lucky.

- <time>Mar 03, 2022</time> Finished with the second iteration of Module 8 practice! Will start [Module 9 and the dreaded F chord](https://www.justinguitar.com/guitar-lessons/the-f-chord-b2-901) soon.

- <time>Feb 22, 2022</time> I've been listening to Wish You Were Here by Pink Floyd in preparation for finishing the riff. I guess it helped a bit? Anyways, almost finished learning the riff and just a few more items are left for the first iteration of Module 1 practice!

- <time>Feb 20, 2022</time> Continued with Module 8 practice.

- <time>Feb 19, 2022</time> Continued with [Module 8](https://www.justinguitar.com/modules/cool-chords-fast-changes-scales) practice. I stink at Big G to D chord transitions.

- <time>Apr 16, 2022</time> Continued with Lesson 3.

- <time>Apr 13, 2022</time> Continued with the Lesson 2 questionnaire and [I've nearly finished with the project for Lesson 2](https://github.com/y-arjun-y/cloudclassifer) (it's a cloud classifier!)

- <time>Apr 03, 2022</time> Found [a replacement for the Bing Search API](https://joedockrill.github.io/blog/projects/imagescraper/) through the [forums](https://forums.fast.ai/t/bing-account-expired-what-other-option/76856/4).

- <time>Mar 17, 2022</time> Continued with Lesson 1. We had to train a classifier that classified an image as a cat or a dog. I tried putting an image of a tiger and a wolf (which are technically a cat and a dog respectively but not really) and it actually gave true and false for the question "Is this image a cat?" respectively!

- <time>Mar 16, 2022</time> Continued with [Lesson 1](http://course.fast.ai/videos/?lesson=1) and got the [fastbook](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook) setup.

- <time>Mar 15, 2022</time> Got started with [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/). Really excited!

- <time>Jun 12, 2022</time> It's funny how a couple of years ago, I would be screaming and running around if I got a sub-15 solve. Now, nothing: 18.392, 5.922, 33.850 and 9.239.

- <time>May 27, 2022</time> Sigh, 3x3 BLD has gotten worse: 19.207, 6.058, 38.293 and 9.943.

- <time>May 26, 2022</time> I was planning to do a 3x3 BLD attempt, but I had to reassemble my Skewb in the middle of my AO5 :/ 19.659, 5.010, 34.842 and 11.210.

- <time>May 25, 2022</time> 20.562, 5.151, 35.957 and 10.113.

- <time>May 19, 2022</time> Again, 3x3 OH could have gone better: 17.624 (!), 5.262, 38.848 and 7.606.

- <time>May 18, 2022</time> 3x3 OH could have gone better: 18.981, 4.761 (!), 38.214 and 8.138.

- <time>May 11, 2022</time> Been having a hard time getting a successful no-write 3x3 BLD attempt: 18.134, 4.266, 33.915 and 8.322.

- <time>Apr 27, 2022</time> 21.066, 7.844, 42.862 and 9.970.

- <time>Apr 26, 2022</time> Disappointingly, [cstimer](https://cstimer.net) (the cubing timer I use) doesn't produce AO1000, so here is the mean for 1000 solves: 21.177, 6.102, 41.186 and 10.019. As for the AO5's: 18.469, 5.554, 33.303 and 10.887. Also, I've spent almost 6 hours in total on 3x3 lol, here's to another 1000!

- <time>Apr 25, 2022</time> 21.078, 6.095, 35.065 and 8.574.

- <time>Apr 24, 2022</time> I finished the BLD attempt too early and forgot to execute the moves to solve the last corner :( Also, day after tomorrow will be the AO1000 day! 19.973, 5.549, 37.311 and 7.746.

- <time>Apr 23, 2022</time> 3x3 OH... 17.459 (!), 5.334, 40.854 and 7.839.

- <time>Apr 22, 2022</time> TS UP VE CX EA LQ! I got a successful 3x3 BLD solve without writing down the memorization during the solve! 18.899, 6.497, 37.569 and 10.569 (I also forgot to mention that a couple days ago I got a 3x3 OH PB lol, 22.402)

- <time>Apr 21, 2022</time> 19.546, 5.346, 39.616 and 10.359.

- <time>Apr 18, 2022</time> Decent I guess: 19.625, 6.814, 38.264 and 11.757. I also tried to do a BLD attempt without writing down the memorization, I messed up because of execution lol.

- <time>Apr 17, 2022</time> Nothing saves the day: 20.620, 5.907, 39.393 and 8.049.

- <time>Apr 16, 2022</time> 3x3 OH saves the day: 20.796, 4.305 (!), 29.552 (!) and 9.895.

- <time>Apr 15, 2022</time> Slightly better: 18.447, 4.443 (!), 39.591 and 7.931.

- <time>Apr 14, 2022</time> Barely passable: 19.618, 6.006, 36.972 and 8.722.

- <time>Apr 13, 2022</time> Never mind? 17.598 (!), 5.175, 33.667 an 10.520. I hate how turbulent my times are. I guess that's cubing in a nutshell.

- <time>Apr 12, 2022</time> Welp, I think we'll be in this time slump for a bit. At least I got a successful 3x3 BLD solve: 20.569, 6.222, 39.119 and 9.908 (Also, I think the change in solving order didn't do much, so I'm back to the original order).

- <time>Apr 11, 2022</time> 22.961, 5.759, 35.432 and 11.559.

- <time>Apr 10, 2022</time> Phew, back on track: 19.187, 5.778, 36.826 and 7.655 (by the way, the order of the averages written haven't changed, but I now do Skewb -> 2x2 -> 3x3 OH -> 3x3).

- <time>Apr 09, 2022</time> Well, it was fun while it lasted: 21.856, 6.137, 37.501 and 10.732.

- <time>Apr 08, 2022</time> Very nice (except for 3x3 OH): 17.276, 5.472, 37.693 and 8.917. I wonder how long it'll take me to get sub-15 on 3x3.

- <time>Apr 07, 2022</time> Nice: 17.101, 5.581, 35.501 and 8.881.

- <time>Apr 06, 2022</time> 100 more solves to go till AO1000! 18.073, 5.867, 38.429 and 8.191.

- <time>Apr 05, 2022</time> 3x3 OH AO5 was terrible: 18.068, 5.591, 40.613 and 9.809.

- <time>Apr 04, 2022</time> Another successful 3x3 BLD solve! 17.372 (!), 5.924, 35.729 and 10.559.

- <time>Apr 03, 2022</time> Today is the greatest day of my life (cubing-wise!), got 3 sub-30 solves in 3x3 OH and great averages all around: 18.990, 5.906, 30.921 (!), 8.003.

  And... I got another successful 3x3 BLD solve! It was so hectic lol, I changed my memorization mid-way through the edges (thankfully) .

- <time>Apr 02, 2022</time> I haven't been able to get a 3x3 BLD attempt (let alone a successful one) in the past 3-ish days. At least the averages are back to normal (for like a day): 18.529, 5.019, 37.587 and 9.230.

- <time>Apr 01, 2022</time> Never mind: 22.649, 5.509, 39.351 and 9.716. I like how my whole day (cubing-wise) gets ruined if my 3x3 AO5 is not sub-20 lol.

- <time>Mar 31, 2022</time> Back to normal: 19.452, 5.065, 32.064 and 9.556.

- <time>Mar 30, 2022</time> 3x3 BLD attempt was off by 3 edges again: 20.618, 5.458, 40.515 and 11.240.

- <time>Mar 29, 2022</time> 22.546, 7.092, 38.206 and 11.234.

- <time>Mar 24, 2022</time> Today's 3x3 BLD attempts were so frustrating, the first one was off by two flipped edges and I kept messing up the execution in the later solves, at least the averages were good: 18.488, 5.382, 39.277 and 8.365.

- <time>Mar 23, 2022</time> I got two sub-20 solves for 3x3 at first, but it all got ruined by a DNF and a +2, it sometimes feel like it's all about luck, anyways: 20.698, 5.174, 35.456 and 13.105.

- <time>Mar 22, 2022</time> Odd 3x3 BLD attempt was so close: 21.064, 5.506, 37.986 and 8.045.

- <time>Mar 21, 2022</time> How did an average with a 40 and a DNF become sub-40? 25.537, 4.964, 39.721 and 9.783.

- <time>Mar 20, 2022</time> Scrambles were very easy: 17.547 (!), 4.941, 38.425 and 11.764.

- <time>Mar 19, 2022</time> Got a 12 second solve for 3x3 but regardless: 21.821, 6.535, 36.357 and 10.273.

- <time>Mar 18, 2022</time> 23.077, 5.853, 41.374 and 10.033.

- <time>Mar 17, 2022</time> 21.405, 6.002, 37.289 and 10.459.

- <time>Mar 16, 2022</time> I guess I got lucky? 18.841, 5.380, 34.834 and 9.340. Today's 3x3 BLD attempt was so close (two edges flipped).

- <time>Mar 15, 2022</time> Forgot about the switch-up: 24.875, 6.812, 35.906 and 11.400.

- <time>Mar 14, 2022</time> My averages have been terrible for the past few ~~months~~ days and so I'm going to switch it up by doing 2x2 first and then proceeding the with normal order (don't worry, the log order will remain the same): 22.462, 5.755, 40.173 and 9.379.

- <time>Mar 13, 2022</time> 200 more solves left for an AO1000: 20.543, 5.996, 36.888 and 9.247.

- <time>Mar 12, 2022</time> This is getting ridiculous: 19.962, 5.636, 40.219 and 11.274.

- <time>Mar 11, 2022</time> Yes? 19.093, 5.612, 37.009, 11.737.

- <time>Mar 10, 2022</time> Nope: 20.098, 7.327, 38.656 and 7.993.

- <time>Mar 09, 2022</time> We're back? 18.709, 5.143, 38.506 and 6.759.

- <time>Mar 08, 2022</time> Meh (x2): 21.662, 6.125, 34.649 and 9.689.

- <time>Mar 07, 2022</time> Meh: 22.201, 5.474, 40.973 and 10.045.

- <time>Mar 06, 2022</time> QX TJ IW ER UO LR, WB XL JD! I DID IT! THE NEW SETUP MOVES ACTUALLY WORKED! I will add a technicality here, I forgot the "JD" part so I peeked at it. A full timed BLD solve coming soon! Averages were meh but that doesn't matter: 20.036 (so close!), 4.361, 40.565 and 8.018.

- <time>Mar 05, 2022</time> I need to stop cubing at night (x2): 23.734, 5.564, 43.749 and 7.136.

- <time>Mar 04, 2022</time> I need to stop cubing at night: 20.598, 7.136, 42.022 and 10.538.

- <time>Mar 03, 2022</time> Sigh: 21.520, 6.214, 36.180 and 8.337, at least I learnt why my "odd" memorizations for 3x3 BLD are always way off (I can't use any setup moves that disrupt the top two corners + the buffer)

- <time>Mar 02, 2022</time> 2x2 was quite a shock: 21.093, 3.474 (!), 44.370 and 9.777.

- <time>Mar 01, 2022</time> Nothing to say really: 22.273, 5.233, 39.433 and 8.907.

- <time>Feb 28, 2022</time> Sigh, the corners for today's BLD attempt were totally wrong and my averages have hit an all-time low: 20.595, 8.103, 40.345 and 12.222.

- <time>Feb 27, 2022</time> It's just a matter of time: 3 corners wrong again (but I re-attempted my memorization whilst being able to look and my corner memorization was slightly wrong). Also, 3x3 PB! (11.764, here's the scramble: F L2 U L2 F2 U2 L2 R2 U2 B' R2 B F R B D2 B' U B F) and the averages were not bad too: 19.507, 5.753, 37.973 and 9.585.

- <time>Feb 26, 2022</time> My 3x3 BLD attempt was agonizingly close, I had three corners that were wrong :(

  Also, averages were (arguably) more disappointing: 22.265, 7.134, 39.826 and 11.307.

- <time>Feb 25, 2022</time> These have got to be my most disappointing averages: 21.324, 7.266, 43.087 and 9.680.

- <time>Feb 24, 2022</time> Back to meh averages: 21.481, 5.477, 36.067 and 9.224.

- <time>Feb 23, 2022</time> So close with today's 3x3 BLD attempt, only about 4 corners were wrong. Today's average were great: 19.330, 4.720, 36.209 and 8.188.

- <time>Feb 22, 2022</time> Got nothing much to say: 21.268, 5.496, 38.223 and 10.216.

- <time>Feb 21, 2022</time> Don't know what's going wrong, but I can't get any correct memorization (one can't be odd and another even) and today's averages were meh (except 3x3 OH, I got a 26!): 23.784, 5.127, 32.972 (!) and 12.093.

- <time>Feb 20, 2022</time> Couldn't get any 3x3 BLD memorization since I kept getting stuck in an "edge loop". Today's 3x3 was tragic. Were it not for that +2 at the end, I would have gotten a 19.879 average. Instead: 20.546, 4.763, 39.881 and 10.050.

- <time>Feb 19, 2022</time> I checked out [another example solve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnCHARaCoi4) and this one memorized corners -> memorized edges -> executed edges -> executed corners. I tried that (with parity) and it was pretty close (~5 corners were wrong). Anyways, today's averages were bad: 25.125, 7.246, 38.246 and 8.772.

- <time>Feb 18, 2022</time> Did a 3x3 BLD attempt while seeing, I'm 99% sure my parity algorithm and corner memorization are always wrong. I'll work on that. The averages were really good: 17.640 (!), 6.461, 38.753 and 8.020.

- <time>Feb 17, 2022</time> Not bad: 19.799, 5.190, 39.064 (was so close to 40 lol) and 8.005. Got a PB today for 2x2 (1.386) and Skewb (3.268)!

- <time>Feb 16, 2022</time> Today's averages were pretty amazing: 19.030, 4.953, 38.781 and 9.570.

- <time>Feb 15, 2022</time> Today's attempt was so close it's annoying, and today's averages were not bad: 21.033, 5.817, 36.105 and a 10.531.

- <time>Feb 14, 2022</time> Even cases still leave my corners all messed up. Today's averages were terrible: 21.927, 7.347, 35.463 and 10.863.

- <time>Feb 13, 2022</time> So close yet so far with BLD, I rechecked my solution and it was right up to the edges, I think parity messed me up, maybe my algorithm is wrong? Today's averages were very meh: 21.658, 6.286, 40.089 and 8.430.

- <time>Feb 12, 2022</time> Well, that upward trajectory lasted longer than [the time the US made $1 coins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gonVHW_X79U): 21.514, 6.383, 34.207 and a 9.668.

- <time>Feb 11, 2022</time> So close! Just messed up my corner memorization (somewhere) and today's averages were great: 19.732, 6.033, 37.433, 9.408.

- <time>Feb 10, 2022</time> We're back: 19.463, 5.182, 35.965 and a 8.541.

- <time>Feb 09, 2022</time> BLD was really close today! I think I've gotten used to the new correct setup moves. Today's averages were sad (could have gotten sub-20 in 3x3 if it wasn't for me messing up PLL): 21.694, 7.680, 40.865 and a 9.638.

- <time>Feb 08, 2022</time> Today's BLD attempt failed spectacularly and today's averages were slightly less meh (emphasis on slightly): 22.500, 5.821, 41.203 and a 8.944.

- <time>Feb 07, 2022</time> Couldn't get today's BLD attempt, and today's were very meh: 24.692, 5.152, 40.385 and a 9.958.

- <time>Feb 06, 2022</time> HOLY CRAP TODAY'S 3X3 BLD ATTEMPT WAS SO CLOSE! Only my corner memorization was a little bit wrong and the buffer for the edge was flipped (which confirms that it's possible, I need to learn what to do in that case). Today's averages were good (except for 3x3, still waiting for a streak of sub-20's): 22.320, 4.962, 35.021 and a 10.029.

- <time>Feb 05, 2022</time> I must be doing something right with 3x3 BLD, I did my edge memorization (while being able to see) and it was all correct. But after doing the parity (which I was supposed to do) the whole corner memorization got messed up. Weird. Anyways, today's averages were meh: 21.027, 6.522, 38.636 and 10.536.

- <time>Feb 04, 2022</time> Okay, [I rewatched an example solve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8EXVRgUHhk) and I realized I've been making a ton of mistakes. I tried to use the new buffer location, but my setup moves are now too complicated. Maybe the buffer location doesn't matter? Anyways, today's averages were better, 3x3 sub-20 coming soon: 20.770, 6.072, 37.997 and a 9.871.

- <time>Feb 03, 2022</time> I don't even want to talk about this day cubing-wise: 20.866, 4.760, 50.749 and 9.291.

- <time>Feb 02, 2022</time> So close! I think the only place I could have potentially gone wrong was returning to the buffer. Today's 3x3 OH average was insane, almost all solves were sub-35: 22.481, 6.097, 34.596 and 8.596.

- <time>Feb 01, 2022</time> Still no luck, will actually try recording my attempt over the weekend to see any mistakes I made after the solve. Today's averages (except 3x3 OH) were meh: 22.537, 6.205, 35.843 and 9.001.

- <time>Jan 31, 2022</time> Nope, that was not the reason. Today's averages were meh again: 22.205, 7.153, 40.376 and 10.354.

- <time>Jan 30, 2022</time> I think I found the reason why my 3x3 BLD attempts have all failed, it's because I didn't do wide setup moves. I'll try again tomorrow (I messed up parity in today's attempt lol). Today's averages were meh: 20.032, 5.665, 36.412 and 10.434.

- <time>Jan 29, 2022</time> The meh-streak continues: 21.008, 5.467, 38.579 and 7.971.

- <time>Jan 28, 2022</time> So close! One good thing that came from today's 3x3 BLD attempt was that everything was generally much faster (memorization + execution), though that could mean the probability of making a mistake is now much higher... Today's averages were meh again (except for 3x3 OH): 21.947, 5.328, 38.148 and a 8.784.

- <time>Jan 27, 2022</time> Thought today would be the day, but nope, I messed up the 3x3 BLD attempt quite badly (though I'm not sure what I did wrong in the attempt, maybe messed up an execution?). Anyways, today's averages (except 3x3) were meh: 18.878 (!), 7.080, 40.929 and 10.494.

- <time>Jan 26, 2022</time> So close! I think I only messed up my corner memorization, the edges were all correct and a few corners hadn't been swapped. Anyways, today's averages were meh again: 20.580, 6.680, 39.801 and a 9.568.

- <time>Jan 25, 2022</time> My closest 3x3 BLD attempt yet! Got every step done, maybe my memoization was wrong. Anyways, today's averages were pretty meh: 19.308, 6.757, 44.479 and a 10.444.

- <time>Jan 24, 2022</time> Pretty bad all around, failed my 3x3 BLD attempt with the same mistake I've been making in the past few attempts (confused between algorithms) and got pretty meh averages: 20.538, 4.140, 54.184 and an 8.206.

- <time>Jan 23, 2022</time> Everything today was very, very sad: 21.869, 5.481, 44.561 and a 9.391.

- <time>Jan 22, 2022</time> Today's 3x3 BLD attempt was so bad it was funny, I thought mid-way the solve that I might get only a few wrong (since I forgot to do the parity algorithm) but nope. Anyways, today's averages were also, well, average. But I did get a 3x3 OH PB (22.402): 20.095, 6.131, 41.337 and an 8.516.

- <time>Jan 21, 2022</time> Got quite close with my 3x3 BLD attempt, one day... Today's averages were pretty meh: 22.241, 5.753, 41.772 and a 9.544.

- <time>Jan 20, 2022</time> I learnt yesterday night why all my 3x3 BLD attempts failed, it's because I swapped the wrong buffer piece and I didn't do the parity algorithm. I corrected both today, a successful attempt should come soon. Today's averages were good: 19.257, 4.985, 36.746 and a 7.840.

- <time>Jan 19, 2022</time> Very strange 3x3 BLD full attempt today, I somehow got all edges correct and no corners correct. Anyways, today's averages were awesome: 19.627 (!), 4.514 (!), 38.066 (!) and a 7.689 (!)

- <time>Jan 18, 2022</time> Today's averages were crazy! Got an 18.415 (!), 4.202 (!), 38.537 (!) and a 9.553. Also did my first full 3x3 BLD attempt, did not go too well but the amount of progress I'm making is amazing.

- <time>Jan 17, 2022</time> Pretty awesome averages today, got a 19.129 (!), 5.254, 37.508 (!) and a 10.109.

- <time>Jan 16, 2022</time> Today was crazy for 2x2, I destroyed my PB, twice in a row, first with a sub-3 (2.589) and then with a sub-2 (1.450), today's averages were nothing too crazy though: 20.102, 5.000 (!), 42.915 and an 8.407.

- <time>Jan 15, 2022</time> I think I've fully learnt 3x3 BLD edges! Will move on to corners tomorrow. As for the times today, a bit disappointed with 3x3 but the rest were alright: 24.521, 6.656, 36.764 (!) and a 7.299 (!)

- <time>Jan 14, 2022</time> I think I have to follow the tutorial again for 3x3 BLD, making the same mistakes over and over again. Anyways, today's averages were awesome, soon to be sort of officially sub-40 3x3 OH and sub-20 3x3: 18.546, 6.218, 35.814 and 10.457.

- <time>Jan 13, 2022</time> Again, got really close to 3x3 BLD edges attempt. As for the times today: I got a 23.001, 6.177, 34.869 (!) and a 10.518.

- <time>Jan 12, 2022</time> SO CLOSE to a true 3x3 BLD edges attempt! I was only one swap away. Anyways, I completed 500 solves in every event, and today's averages were a 21.648, 5.759, 43.116 and a 10.973.

- <time>Jan 11, 2022</time> So close to sub-40 AO5 for 3x3 OH, but I messed up the last solve. Will move on to memorizing corners for 3x3 BLD and today's times are a 20.929, 5.127, 40.641 and a 9.240.

- <time>Jan 10, 2022</time> Pretty great for 2x2, got a 20.645, 4.702 (!), 43.245 and a 10.341.

- <time>Jan 09, 2022</time> Today was crazy for 3x3 OH again, got a 21.468, 6.339, 37.748 (!) and a 10.506.

- <time>Jan 08, 2022</time> Amazing day! Got a 3x3 OH PB (24.204) (!) and great averages for 3x3 and 3x3 OH: 19.394 (!), 6.030, 35.962 (!) and a 10.915.

- <time>Jan 07, 2022</time> Not bad, got a 21.398, 5.979, 41.616 and a 10.386.

- <time>Jan 06, 2022</time> Amazing averages! Got a 19.056 (!), 5.725, 39.427 and a 8.321.

- <time>Jan 05, 2022</time> Progress! I solved the 3x3 BLD edges (though I could see the cube, just trying to get my memorization correct) and today's 2x2 was crazy good. 20.787, 4.923 (!), 40.937 and a 10.749.

- <time>Jan 04, 2022</time> Started with my 3x3 BLD practice (though it will be a slow journey) and I got a 20.636, 6.771, 44.624 and an 8.753.

- <time>Jan 03, 2022</time> Pretty good day, got another successful 2x2 BLD solve, going to move on to 3x3 BLD with [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZ41gWvltT8), as for the times, I got a 19.373 (!), 6.114, 41.561 and a 9.421.

- <time>Jan 02, 2022</time> **P**a**N**ama **T**imes **S**omething **G**oes **M**ad! That was the memorization for my first ever legit 2x2 BLD solve! I did it again (though the scramble was pretty easy). As for the times today, they were pretty mid: 20.916, 5.551, 44.045 and a 9.939.

- <time>Jan 01, 2022</time> Happy new year! Getting really close with 2x2 BLD, I think my main problem is what I memorize is wrong, the memorization and solving part is not hard. Anyways, I got a 21.460, 6.278, 45.938, 9.669.

- <time>Dec 31, 2021</time> Still no luck with 2x2 BLD, but the times today were not bad, nearly got a 3x3 OH PB (29.480): 20.790, 6.353, 37.504 (!) and a 8.922. Hope to go for a competition in 2022!

- <time>Dec 30, 2021</time> No luck with 2x2 BLD still and a pretty average day, 21.719, 6.508, 43.146 and a 11.594.

- <time>Dec 29, 2021</time> So close! I attempted 2x2 BLD (by closing my eyes lol) thrice and got only two pieces unsolved in the last two attempts. Hopefully, by the end of this week, I'll know how to solve it BLD. Anyways, today's times were nothing great: 23.027, 6.431, 43.704 and 8.318.

- <time>Dec 28, 2021</time> Alright day, got a 21.078, 5.375, 39.117 (!) and a 12.108.

- <time>Dec 27, 2021</time> [Solved a 2x2 with the Old Pochmann method!](https://www.speedcubereview.com/blind-solving-algorithms.html#:~:text=Old%20Pochmann%20is%20a%20basic,it%20with%20the%20bank%20piece.) (though I wasn't blindfolded, and I can only do it if I don't have a new cycle, I'll have to revise that), as for the times, I got a 19.002 (!), 5.674, 40.539 and 9.591.

- <time>Dec 26, 2021</time> Made good progress learning 2x2 blindfolded [with this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pHnmNeoJkQ&t=168s) and got alright times for today: 21.616, 6.931, 39.859 (!) and a 10.084.

- <time>Dec 25, 2021</time> Meh, got a 21.567, 5.878, 40.827 and a 9.778.

- <time>Dec 24, 2021</time> Learnt full PLL on 3x3! As for the times, I got a 21.452, 5.898, 41.674 and a 10.835.

- <time>Dec 23, 2021</time> 400 solves! The AO100's are 21.074, 6.508, 41.509 and 9.773, the AO5's I got are a 18.486 (!), 5.573, 46.521 and a 9.611.

- <time>Dec 22, 2021</time> Getting better, 5 more solves till 400 for each event! As for the times, I got a 20.635, 5.822, 37.404 (!) and a 9.471.

- <time>Dec 21, 2021</time> Meh again, got a 21.244, 6.696, 40.381 and a 10.185. Learnt the Gc perm, only one more to go!

- <time>Dec 20, 2021</time> Even worse this time, got a 20.709, 7.065, 48.662 and a 10.913.

#### Log

- <time>Oct 01, 2022</time> Welp, the program got cancelled. I'll see if I can attend it next year.

- <time>Sep 10, 2022</time> Had a great first pre-requisite class! Excited to be brushing-up on some ML models next week.

<small>Jul 08, 2022-Sep 03, 2022</small>  
<small>Re-designed EA Bristol's website. The latter project mentioned (which ended on Aug 09, 2022) was entangled with the former and I will be vague when describing the latter project in the logs.</small>

<hr />

#### Log

- <time>Sep 03, 2022</time> Sent over the design file, which marks the end of this nearly two-month project!

- <time>Aug 27, 2022</time> Got started with a triangle for the hero section (it's a lot trickier than it sounds!)

- <time>Aug 26, 2022</time> Got started with the navigation bar.

- <time>Aug 23, 2022</time> "Got started" with programming.

- <time>Aug 22, 2022</time> Continued with the design, will start programming tomorrow.

- <time>Aug 21, 2022</time> Overhaul for one of the pages is done (?), will collect everything tomorrow for a second overall draft.

- <time>Aug 20, 2022</time> Sent over an overall draft and worked on slightly overhauling one of the pages.

- <time>Aug 19, 2022</time> Yep, it is. Finished a draft of the last (?) page.

- <time>Aug 17, 2022</time> I think this project is back from the dead?

- <time>Aug 09, 2022</time> There may be a few more developments, but I consider the booking project done! Also, the EA Bristol project has been dropped, so this project as a whole is done.

- <time>Aug 08, 2022</time> Nearly done with migration (and the booking project)

- <time>Aug 07, 2022</time> Got started with migration (nearly done?)

- <time>Aug 03, 2022</time> Finished with authentication.

- <time>Aug 02, 2022</time> Nearly done with authentication!

- <time>Aug 01, 2022</time> Continued with authentication, need to start from scratch with authentication from tomorrow as I'm making very little progress.

- <time>Jul 31, 2022</time> Continued with authentication.

- <time>Jul 30, 2022</time> Alright, a small hiccup but another project has been entangled with this project. All (?) gaps can be explained as me working on the latter project.

  Anyways, continued with authentication.

- <time>Jul 25, 2022</time> Finished (?) with the hero section and finished the first draft of the about us page.

- <time>Jul 12, 2022</time> Toyed around with mosaics.

- <time>Jul 10, 2022</time> Finished with the second draft of the "hero section" and got feedback.

<small>I was getting increasingly dissatisfied with [Bear Blog](https://bearblog.dev) (where this website was formerly). So I decided to migrate to Next.js and [I made a template](https://github.com/y-arjun-y/bear-blog-replacement-template) that [I posted on Show HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32382716).</small>

<small>Trying to co-lead a rationality club in my school. We've finished the first edition of SOLARIS!</small>

<hr />

#### Log

- <time>Aug 07, 2022</time> Fifth meeting happened, which means the first edition of SOLARIS is complete! While there have been a few hiccups en route, it was generally a good time. I hope more people come for the second edition!

- <time>Aug 06, 2022</time> Finished the feedback form for tomorrow.

- <time>Jul 31, 2022</time> Fourth meeting happened with much better attendance and overall a pretty fruitful discussion! I'm happy to have had that with the most important week.

- <time>Jul 25, 2022</time> Third meeting happened without much fanfare. Hopefully attendance is higher next meeting.

- <time>Jul 23, 2022</time> Worked on next meeting's presentation.

- <time>Jul 18, 2022</time> Second meeting happened yesterday: Attendance improved a lot and it was a bummer that I couldn't attend fully.

- <time>Jul 12, 2022</time> First meeting happened day before yesterday: even though it was a fair amount of fun, I messed up the recording and we unfortunately had low attendance.

<small>Not exactly sure why, but I spent some time trying to solve at least one sudoku every Friday & Saturday.

- <time>May 18, 2022</time> Took me 27 minutes, but I solved a medium sudoku without misusing the guess checker!: ...9..87....67.....6...45....61..2....4..2....27...4......16..8.....97.153.......

- <time>May 17, 2022</time> Sigh: 2..4....94.7.......6..8....7...9.165.....12....23...9...97.28.3...9....13.4......

- <time>May 11, 2022</time> Took advantage of the guess checker again: .......7..6.1....4..8..5.9....6..23.584.......2.....1.49..1....3...74.......3...6

- <time>May 10, 2022</time> Solved my first medium puzzle! (Though I did take advantage of the guess checker, going to turn that off tomorrow): .........43.....7......1.4694..7.6.5..3...7..56..4..3..2.19.......7..3...9..24...

- <time>May 09, 2022</time> Medium puzzles still feel impossible: 9...4...3.........5.4.1......5.7...8...1...6.8.29...4.4.9.5.7........28....697...

<small>Apr 07, 2022-May 17, 2022</small>  
<small>Created a simple website/API to create a customizable world map.</small>

<hr />

#### Log

- <time>May 17, 2022</time> Added width and height URL queries, [used gallpeters for this very website](/analytics/), updated the repository, opened up [a Show HN post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31410053) and this project is done!

<img src="/gallpeters.jpg" />

- <time>May 16, 2022</time> `<iframe>`'s now work!

- <time>May 15, 2022</time> Nearly done with the headers, just need to get `<iframe>`'s to work.

- <time>May 14, 2022</time> Security headers are the necessary evil in programming.

- <time>May 13, 2022</time> Alright, it's deployed! (but I need to add security headers)

- <time>May 12, 2022</time> Deploying a Node.js website is laughably hard. I got it deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) but none of the assets went through (so it's basically useless). Will keep trying tomorrow.

- <time>May 11, 2022</time> Finished with the API reference, going to deploy it tomorrow.

- <time>May 10, 2022</time> Got started with API reference.

- <time>May 09, 2022</time> Alright, I'm pretty sure no major glitch remains. I'll be adding the API reference and putting this on [Show HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/show) tomorrow.

- <time>May 08, 2022</time> For some odd reason, most of the customization logic from yesterday stopped working. Anyways, got it all back and HEX color support isn't glitchy anymore. This project is nearing its end!

- <time>May 07, 2022</time> Got all of the customization options to work as URL queries!

- <time>May 06, 2022</time> Not bad, got one of the customizations to work (the background color). Not fully sure why the others aren't working but I'll look in to that. You can now also enter a country name without following title case + with spaces + with 'of' or 'the'.

- <time>May 05, 2022</time> Awesome progress, you can now select any amount of countries with either the [three-letter name](https://laendercode.net/en/3-letter-list.html) or the full name with the API. I now need to implement the customization logic with URL queries, should be fun...

- <time>May 04, 2022</time> I can now create any one of the three projection types with `/api/map_name` (e.g.: `/api/gallpeters`)!

- <time>May 03, 2022</time> Got started with the API.

- <time>May 02, 2022</time> Committed the customization changes with two reset buttons!

- <time>May 01, 2022</time> Continued with the color conversion logic and "fixed" the hex to RGB function (just had to change the return).

- <time>Apr 30, 2022</time> Continued with the color conversion logic.

- <time>Apr 29, 2022</time> Continued with the customization logic, it's coming out pretty nicely, [just need to convert the different ways to represent color to RGB](http://web.simmons.edu/~grovesd/comm244/notes/week3/css-colors).

- <time>Apr 28, 2022</time> Continued with the customization logic, I can now sort of customise the background color and the stroke with the front-end.

- <time>Apr 26, 2022</time> Got started with the customization logic.

- <time>Apr 24, 2022</time> Sort of finished with the saving logic (though I need to add customization properties) [thanks to this Stack Overflow page](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23218174/how-do-i-save-export-an-svg-file-after-creating-an-svg-with-d3-js-ie-safari-an).

- <time>Apr 23, 2022</time> Got started with the "saving" logic.

- <time>Apr 22, 2022</time> Made great progress: created the "click" logic and fixed the viewport and some outdated country names in the JSON file.

- <time>Apr 21, 2022</time> Haha I figured it out! You have to use the `d` in the mouseover function to get the data of each indivudual `path`, like so:

```
    tooltip.html(d.toElement.__data__.properties.name);
```

- <time>Apr 19, 2022</time> One of the more frustrating things in this world is working with nested data. All of the country names (for the tooltips) are nested and I can't access them without an additional CSV file with the names that has the same IDs as the JSON file. Sigh.

- <time>Apr 18, 2022</time> The first step (selecting which map projection you want to use) is done, going to have to work on tooltips for the second step.

- <time>Apr 17, 2022</time> Created all the three projections, going to work on the "creating" part.

- <time>Apr 16, 2022</time> Made the maps look a whole lot nicer. I'm going to start out with three projections: Mercator, Gall Peters and Winkel Tripel.

- <time>Apr 15, 2022</time> Fixed the "... isn't a function" error, I had to update the version of d3-geo-projection imported. Anyways, I've got the namesake projection!

- <time>Apr 14, 2022</time> I was trying to get the Gall Peters projection in D3, and ended up with the Mercator projection lol, for some reason [geoCylindricalEqualArea()](https://github.com/d3/d3-geo-projection) isn't a function.

- <time>Apr 13, 2022</time> The start of something new:
  ![gallpeters](/gallpeters.png)

- <time>Apr 12, 2022</time> I was about to give up with D3 on the server-side until I found [this repository](https://github.com/gregjopa/d3-server-side-demo).

- <time>Apr 11, 2022</time> [I might go back to Express](https://bl.ocks.org/tomgp/c99a699587b5c5465228).

- <time>Apr 10, 2022</time> Migrated to [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) after deleting all my uncommitted code.

- <time>Apr 09, 2022</time> Getting D3 in to [Node](https://nodejs.dev/) is a bit different. You have to use this [package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/d3-node) and _some_ of the D3 declarations have to be replaced with the package (like in this [example](https://github.com/d3-node/d3-node/blob/820c7103f5c75591d0f501a39981ff1c883b91b9/examples/map-counties.js)).

- <time>Apr 08, 2022</time> Used my [beech.css](https://github.com/y-arjun-y/beech.css) (which powers this website!) and modified it slightly. The majority of my time on this project will be working on the [D3](https://d3js.org/) maps (for now).

- <time>Apr 07, 2022</time> New project! Let's see how long this one takes. Opened up [the repository](https://github.com/y-arjun-y/gallpeters) and committed a bare-bones front-end with [Express](https://expressjs.com/).

The two EA Forum posts ([1](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/CQaNyJfsRFZhseiLZ/effectivealtruismdata-com-a-website-for-aggregating-and), [2](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/c5f9bL8f3YenLmqSc/new-data-visualisations-of-the-ea-forum)) may also prove informative.</small>

#### Log

- <time>Apr 15, 2022</time> Unfortunately, I believe my teammate has somewhat abandoned this project, which is completely fine, this project feels somewhat complete and even if my teammate comes back to work on this project, I don't think I would be able to contribute anything meaningful anymore.

  Regardless, it was a lot of fun while it lasted: learning about Dash, improving my Python skills, messing with Heroku and improving the front-end with my CSS skills were all great experiences.

- <time>Apr 04, 2022</time> Changed 'Lighter/Bluer' to 'Lighter' to remove any ambiguity.

- <time>Apr 02, 2022</time> Okay, this may be stretching my [OOP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object-oriented_programming) skills. Regardless, I removed unused imports from the codebase.

- <time>Apr 01, 2022</time> I might work on getting the label position for some of the plots in line with [this](https://dkane.net/2020/better-horizontal-bar-charts-with-plotly/).

- <time>Mar 31, 2022</time> Changed the background color of the flashcards to a nice and soft one.

- <time>Mar 29, 2022</time> [Got MathJax to work](https://stackoverflow.com/a/66441587/15329048) and created [a PR for the EA-numbers repository to close an issue](https://github.com/benthamite/EA-numbers/pull/3).

- <time>Mar 24, 2022</time> Fixed a small import error.

- <time>Mar 23, 2022</time> Fixed the sidebar glitch.

- <time>Mar 22, 2022</time> Made some good progress with the sidebar glitch, just need to fix another glitch that came from fixing the glitch. Welcome to programming, folks.

- <time>Mar 21, 2022</time> In the process of fixing a small sidebar glitch.

- <time>Mar 20, 2022</time> [Got my fork deployed](https://effectivealtruismdata.herokuapp.com/).

- <time>Mar 19, 2022</time> Finished with cleaning up the codebase for the most part.

- <time>Mar 18, 2022</time> Continued with cleaning up the codebase.

- <time>Mar 17, 2022</time> Removed all instances of the now redundant visdcc and got started cleaning up the codebase. effectivealtruismdata.com should have a valid HTTPS certificate now.

- <time>Mar 16, 2022</time> Never mind, I changed the layout to one long column and so it's automatically responsive. I'll be migrating to deferred JS instead of visdcc.

- <time>Mar 15, 2022</time> Finished work on the flashcards on desktop, need to make the whole thing responsive.

- <time>Mar 13, 2022</time> Flashcard progress has been slow, but we push on.

- <time>Mar 12, 2022</time> Tried to deploy a copy of the repository on Heroku, to no avail.

- <time>Mar 11, 2022</time> effectivealtruismdata.com is really unreliable right now (it's sometimes down and regardless the [HTTPS](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-https/) certificate has expired) and I can't do anything tangible about it.

- <time>Mar 10, 2022</time> Got started with fixing the layout. This is going to take a while...

- <time>Mar 09, 2022</time> Fixed a small glitch with the hide/reveal feature. I have a pretty good idea for organising the card in one-line (with arrows to scroll) which I'll get started with tomorrow.

- <time>Mar 08, 2022</time> Using deferred JS, I made the flashcards "studyable" as you can reveal and hide the answer (+ source) and I'll be working on making the layout better.

- <time>Mar 07, 2022</time> Continued with the flashcards. Progress has been slow.

- <time>Mar 06, 2022</time> Holy crap, the package works! In the process of replacing all of the (now redundant) callbacks and I can now do some serious envisioning with the flashcards with the power of JS.

- <time>Mar 05, 2022</time> Tried to get MathJax with [this package](https://pypi.org/project/dash-defer-js-import/) but to no avail. I'll keep trying (as that'll mean I can defer any JS file). I'll also be mainly fixing the layout of these flashcards for a while.

- <time>Mar 04, 2022</time> A bit unsatisfied with the layout of the flashcards. Anyways, committed a spelling fix for my previous X-risks relative probabilities.

- <time>Mar 03, 2022</time> Not a ton of progress but I've made the flexbox in to roughly 7-8 columns. Going to try to get [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) and JS (deferred) tomorrow.

- <time>Mar 02, 2022</time> Good progress, the content now looks like flashcards (though they're all in one long sequence, which is not ideal, need to have arrows on the left and right side to browse through them) and I added the appropriate classes for the question, answer and source.
- <time>Mar 01, 2022</time> I did it! Got all the three paragraph tags packed into "card divs". I'll work on the actual styling tomorrow.

- <time>Feb 28, 2022</time> Made decent progress again, still trying to get the cards (in packs of three paragraph tags).

- <time>Feb 27, 2022</time> Decent amount of progress, I need to somehow get all the elements between two "card divisions" (just big rectangles) and then I can style them into cards with [flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) magic.

- <time>Feb 26, 2022</time> Got it all converted to HTML! Need to now turn it all into cards (which may take some time...)

- <time>Feb 25, 2022</time> Got all the text displayed, need to convert it in to regular HTML.

- <time>Feb 24, 2022</time> Alright, got the data and I need to figure out how to use a for loop in Dash components tomorrow. After that, all the text will be displayed and I'll need to do some CSS + JS magic to make them actual cards.

- <time>Feb 22, 2022</time> Figured out an alright way to display the cards (it'll be a bunch of CSS work which I guess I'm good at) and I finished creating the layout for it.

- <time>Feb 21, 2022</time> Realistically speaking, the only thing left on the to-do list I can do is to display the [key EA numbers](https://github.com/benthamite/EA-numbers), so that's what I'm going to do.

- <time>Feb 18, 2022</time> Emailed my teammate about the X-risks section of the website.

- <time>Feb 17, 2022</time> No excuse for not working on this for the last 4 days, anyways I don't think I have the technical skill to fix the bar chart. I'll work on something else.

- <time>Feb 12, 2022</time> Continued with the bar chart.

- <time>Feb 11, 2022</time> Finished with the layout and figured out how the bar chart function works (sort of).

- <time>Feb 10, 2022</time> Got started with the layout.

- <time>Feb 09, 2022</time> Finished collecting the data, also it's not just the top 5 charities (that would be very little data) and I'll work on the bar chart tomorrow.

- <time>Feb 08, 2022</time> Started with the data collection. Got a good suggestion from my Focusmate (who's also interested EA)!

- <time>Feb 07, 2022</time> Alright, will work on plotting the cost-effectiveness of the top 5 most effective charities according to [The Life You Can Save](https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/).

- <time>Feb 04, 2022</time> Got a few ideas for what to work on next, still thinking about it.

- <time>Feb 01, 2022</time> Committed the new icons! Wondering what to work on next.

- <time>Jan 30, 2022</time> Finished adding the higher quality icons from [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com)!

- <time>Jan 28, 2022</time> Honestly adding the timeline section seems pointless, not sure why it's on the to-do list. Anyways, in the process of replacing the icons in the x-risks section with higher quality ones.

- <time>Jan 26, 2022</time> Forget the D3 addition, that was useless. I figured out [about Gantt plots](https://plotly.com/python/gantt/) and added that in. I'll work on making the data soon.

- <time>Jan 25, 2022</time> Didn't have too much time to work on EA Data today, but I continued trying to add D3 into Dash.

- <time>Jan 24, 2022</time> I think the best way to go around this is with [D3](https://d3js.org/), so I'm trying to get D3 into [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/).

- <time>Jan 23, 2022</time> I'll leave the population data to my teammate (as they'll visualize it much more interestingly), I've gotten started on something I find more interesting, [the timescale from William MacAskill's talk](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/AoHgbYvTjHnQw8kWX/what-we-owe-the-future-will-macaskill#Civilisational_collapse_).

- <time>Jan 22, 2022</time> Got to work on the dropdown menus, though I need to figure out a way to make them inline.

- <time>Jan 21, 2022</time> Finished the layout, need to add dropdown menus for years/decades for the quick facts which might take some time.

- <time>Jan 20, 2022</time> Got started with the layout!

- <time>Jan 19, 2022</time> Have some cool ideas on how to present these quick facts on population. Will implement them tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.

- <time>Jan 18, 2022</time> Finished collecting historical population data (from [here](https://github.com/datasets/population)) and trying to find some interesting [longtermist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longtermism) data.

- <time>Jan 17, 2022</time> I sent an email to The Life You Can Save if there was an API for their calculator. I'll be working on another thing in the meanwhile and I also committed my x-risks section.

- <time>Jan 16, 2022</time> Alright, found another thing I can reasonably do for EA Data right now, which is the cost of saving a life with effective charities (which you can learn about [here](https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/impact-calculator/), this will also be my primary data source). I'll work on this tomorrow since I didn't have much time today.

- <time>Jan 15, 2022</time> Completed the table with relative probabilities and icons!

- <time>Jan 14, 2022</time> Fixed the styling for the most part, just need to find a way to shrink the table a bit.

- <time>Jan 13, 2022</time> Continued fixing the styling.

- <time>Jan 12, 2022</time> Finished the images and relative probabilities! Need to fix some styling and will continue with the next time on the to-do list.

- <time>Jan 11, 2022</time> Almost finished with the images and relative probabilities, it's somehow hard to find creative examples for 1 in 10 and 1 in 50.

- <time>Jan 10, 2022</time> Made great progress with the images and relative probabilities! I only have a few left.

- <time>Jan 09, 2022</time> Fully fixed the callback (it's a lot snappier and doesn't randomly break) with [this](https://community.plotly.com/t/dash-v1-7-0-released-async-component-fixes-inline-clientside-callbacks-and-bug-fixes/31961) and got done with the second probability. [Did you know the chance of finding a four-leaf clover is 1 in 10,000?](https://stacker.com/stories/2343/odds-50-random-events-happening-you)

- <time>Jan 08, 2022</time> Fixed the callback for the most part and now the associated image shows up.

- <time>Jan 07, 2022</time> Made the callback automatic (but it's slightly broken) and learnt what ['one in a million'](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~aldous/Real-World/million.html) really means.

- <time>Jan 06, 2022</time> Used visdcc to make it update differently depending on what cell you are on!

- <time>Jan 05, 2022</time> Created the callback.

- <time>Jan 04, 2022</time> It's all coming together, styled the table a bit (may need to add some more further) and started writing the callback code to display the relative probabilities and an animation (or maybe just an image).

- <time>Jan 03, 2022</time> Made good progress with the probabilities table (i.e. I made a CSV file of the probabilities...), I have some cool ideas with using callbacks and then displaying (for example) 1 in 6 chance as the probability of getting 1 when rolling a die (and showing a die animation), but it's a lot of work.

- <time>Jan 02, 2022</time> Started with showing the [probabilities given by Toby Ord on X-Risks](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwbqmbkdb/image/upload/v1586225593/Table_6.1_td3bzd.png), will try my shot at putting the probabilities in a more relative scale.

- <time>Jan 01, 2022</time> Going to set that glitch aside and going to see if I can update some of the data on the website, mainly the [EA Survey](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/effective-altruism-survey).

- <time>Dec 31, 2021</time> Still perplexed by that glitch, hope to do more data visualization with other organisations and to continue work on the website in 2022!

- <time>Dec 30, 2021</time> Continued the discussion about the scaling/overlap issue. I think it is solely a CSS issue, so I'll try my luck at fixing it again tomorrow.

- <time>Dec 29, 2021</time> [Got a response](https://community.plotly.com/t/scaling-plots-in-dash-responsiveness/59594/2) and I gave the deployed website as a working example of the glitch.

- <time>Dec 28, 2021</time> Posted my [issue on the Dash forum](https://community.plotly.com/t/scaling-plots-in-dash-responsiveness/59594).

- <time>Dec 27, 2021</time> I think I'll leave the height glitch for some time, I'll make a post about it on the [Dash forum](https://community.plotly.com/) tomorrow.

- <time>Dec 25, 2021</time> Still no luck with the height glitch, will push on.

- <time>Dec 24, 2021</time> Found a glitch where if you download a data source and then change the height of the browser window, the download subtitle goes crazy. In general, changing the height makes everything go crazy. Trying to fix that.

- <time>Dec 23, 2021</time> Fixed the meta card image. Going to work on responsiveness for a bit. After that, I'll look into completing [this to-do list.](https://github.com/hamishhuggard/ea_data_viz#to-do)

- <time>Dec 22, 2021</time> Took a lot of searching, but I got meta tags to work!

- <time>Dec 21, 2021</time> Still figuring out meta tags and cards.

- <time>Dec 20, 2021</time> Finished the rest of the download links, going to work on meta tags (which I left a while back) and possibly making sure the whole design is as responsive as possible.

- <time>Dec 19, 2021</time> Added the styling, the arbitrary values are not perfect (one of the reasons responsive design is such a pain) but the content is readable, so it's fine for now. I'll work on finishing the rest of the download links tomorrow.

- <time>Dec 18, 2021</time> The design is almost perfect, responsiveness wise, the only real issue is that some of the subtitles have their heights messed up on mobile. So, I made good progress on a glitch fix for that, only need to style it tomorrow.

- <time>Dec 17, 2021</time> Okay so I got the attribute working, but the attribute itself only works in Safari, Chrome doesn't respond to it and just opens the download in a new tab, anyways I'd consider getting the attribute a success.

- <time>Dec 16, 2021</time> More weird glitches (particularly on mobile), I can't seem to get a download to happen on mobile, tried to use visdcc to append an attribute but it didn't work.

- <time>Dec 15, 2021</time> Finished the donation download URL's and fixed a weird glitch where the subtitle would disappear if something was downloading.

- <time>Dec 14, 2021</time> Started work on finishing my teammate's download URL's.

- <time>Dec 13, 2021</time> Time to move on, finished implementing a download icon for my teammate's recent work.

- <time>Dec 12, 2021</time> Finished with all my figures, waiting for a review from my teammate.

- <time>Dec 11, 2021</time> Using [Web Plot Digitizer](https://apps.automeris.io/wpd) to approximately get the data from pre-existing graphs, a really cool piece of technology!

- <time>Dec 10, 2021</time> Fixed some major mistakes I made and nearly finished the actual last figure.

- <time>Dec 09, 2021</time> Finished my last assigned figure (for the most part, might need to make a few small tweaks here and there), need to now get to the actual data part.

- <time>Dec 08, 2021</time> Made good progress with the next figure. I'll leave the actual data for later.

- <time>Dec 07, 2021</time> Figured out how to work with large scale CSV.

- <time>Dec 06, 2021</time> Implemented the horizontal bar chart change + some other changes. Need to figure out how to work with large scale [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) files.

- <time>Dec 05, 2021</time> Finished the first figure, though I might need to make them horizontal instead of vertical bar charts.

- <time>Dec 04, 2021</time> Nearly finished the first figure.

- <time>Dec 02, 2021</time> Progress, progress, progress.

- <time>Dec 01, 2021</time> Continued work on data visualization, need to get good at matplotlib.

- <time>Nov 30, 2021</time> Continued work on data visualization with matplotlib, awesome month at EA Data!

- <time>Nov 29, 2021</time> Did some experimenting with [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/).

- <time>Nov 28, 2021</time> [Opened a PR](https://github.com/hamishhuggard/ea_data_viz/pull/12) to push smaller bug tweaks I've made over the month.

- <time>Nov 27, 2021</time> Doing some research into deployment.

- <time>Nov 22, 2021</time> Made the title more responsive.

- <time>Nov 21, 2021</time> Slightly changed the GWWC glitch fix.

- <time>Nov 20, 2021</time> Fixed a visdcc glitch!

- <time>Nov 19, 2021</time> Wondering what to do next.

- <time>Nov 18, 2021</time> Fixed the GWWC glitch! It was just 4 lines of [CSS](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html).

- <time>Nov 17, 2021</time> Still trying to fix the GWWC plots.

- <time>Nov 15, 2021</time> I've put the meta tag issue aside to work on fixing the [GWWC](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/) plots.

- <time>Nov 13, 2021</time> The problem with the meta tags is that all the properties are in one tag. Need to fix that.

- <time>Nov 11, 2021</time> [Figured it out.](https://ngrok.com)

- <time>Nov 10, 2021</time> Wondering if there is another way to test if my meta tags work (without hosting the app on Heroku)

- <time>Nov 09, 2021</time> Failed to set up [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) ([for my GitHub fork](https://github.com/y-arjun-y/ea_data_viz)).

- <time>Nov 08, 2021</time> Made the loading screen more responsive and added [Twitter card meta tags](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-for-websites/cards/guides/getting-started).

- <time>Nov 07, 2021</time> Sort of fixed a non-existent glitch. I'll try to switch from glitch fixing to something else.

- <time>Nov 06, 2021</time> Fixed the dark mode button glitch!

- <time>Nov 05, 2021</time> Continued with trying to fix the dark mode button glitch, I found another pip package, but it doesn't look very helpful. Also reviewed my PR for the sidebar glitch.

- <time>Nov 04, 2021</time> Tried fixing the dark mode button glitch.

- <time>Nov 03, 2021</time> [Opened a PR to fix the sidebar glitch](https://github.com/hamishhuggard/ea_data_viz/pull/10).

- <time>Nov 02, 2021</time> Finally fixed the glitch! Took so darn long, but I finally found a way to fix it via [this obscure package](https://github.com/jimmybow/visdcc).

- <time>Nov 01, 2021</time> Again, very little progress. But, little progress is still better than no progress.

- <time>Oct 31, 2021</time> Very little progress on fixing the sidebar glitch, I was really close until I released you cannot scroll on `div` below a button that covers up the whole thing.

- <time>Oct 30, 2021</time> Updated the README file, and started work on fixing the sidebar glitch on mobile using a button.

- <time>Oct 29, 2021</time> Fixed the glitch, [created a PR for the new loading screen](https://github.com/hamishhuggard/ea_data_viz/pull/9) and tried to fix the sidebar glitch on mobile.

- <time>Oct 28, 2021</time> Was so close to making a PR, but I noticed a glitch that'll have to wait till tomorrow to be fixed.

#### Log

- <time>Apr 06, 2022</time> I think this is a safe place to end the project. I'm genuinely proud with the end result (even though it doesn't fully work on Android and it's unlikely that this becomes a popular tool) and, in the end, I learnt a lot about Next.js, user authentication, databases, APIs and back-end development in general :)

- <time>Apr 05, 2022</time> [Opened another Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71749968/is-it-even-possible-to-open-a-third-party-app-in-the-browser-with-an-intentinte).

- <time>Apr 04, 2022</time> Very little progress. I feel that all of this is impossible and that the project (on Android at least) is dead.

- <time>Apr 02, 2022</time> All this `intent:#Intent` stuff is really weird. One link will open Gmail... but on the Google Play Store, another will randomly opening settings. I found this, but it doesn't work:

```
intent:#Intent;action=com.google.android.gm;
category=android.intent.category.DEFAULT
;category=android.intent.category.BROWSABLE;end
```

- <time>Apr 01, 2022</time> Progress! [I stumbled upon this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15554029/how-do-i-open-any-app-from-my-web-browser-chrome-in-android-what-do-i-have-to) which lead to me googling "gmail package name android" which [brought me back to the URI world](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55842939/how-to-open-gmail-in-android).

- <time>Mar 30, 2022</time> Installing React Native appears to be a nightmare.

- <time>Mar 24, 2022</time> I'm going to experiment with React Native (within the preexisting codebase) to fix the Android issue.

- <time>Mar 23, 2022</time> Fixed a small `span` inline style glitch and replied to [the answer I got on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/71576747/15329048).

- <time>Mar 22, 2022</time> [Posted a question on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71571491/url-scheme-to-open-gmail-native-app-from-chrome-on-android).

- <time>Mar 21, 2022</time> The land of URL Schemes/Universal Links/App Links/whatever is treacherous on Android. Every time I felt I got close to an answer, I got thrown into a loop.

  I fear that having a link that opens, say, Gmail's native app is not under my control, rather Google has to implement that. I'll try again tomorrow and if I'm unsuccessful, I'll write up a question on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com).

- <time>Mar 20, 2022</time> Fixed a small footer glitch. If this project of mine ever gets big, I need to have a style guide [like this one](https://design-style-guide.freecodecamp.org/).

- <time>Mar 19, 2022</time> Continued with Android research. I fear that I'll have to use [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/linking).

- <time>Mar 18, 2022</time> Okay, [the emulator I installed](https://bluestacks.com) seems to make bettermailto think I'm on desktop (I think?) so of course the `googlemail://` URL scheme won't work. Need to do further research.

- <time>Mar 17, 2022</time> Got an Android emulator sort of setup on another device.

- <time>Mar 16, 2022</time> One person on the Show HN thread said that the providers are broken on Android. Tried to get an Android emulator but I don't think that exists for [M1 Macs](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211814).

- <time>Mar 15, 2022</time> Alright, [I publicized bettermailto on Show HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30682412) after spending nearly an hour trying to fix the automated test feature (it was futile, the free plan for [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) runs non-instant tasks only every 15 minutes).

- <time>Mar 14, 2022</time> I was **this** close to posting bettermailto on [Show Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/show) but I realized that the test feature on the front-page is completely broken. Need to fix that.

- <time>Mar 13, 2022</time> The eslint errors are really strict!

- <time>Mar 12, 2022</time> Finished with adding security headers. Need to sit down and fix some [eslint](https://eslint.org) errors that I've been ignoring.

- <time>Mar 11, 2022</time> I improved the grade for bettermailto from a D to a C on SecurityHeaders.com. Not bad, need to add a couple more headers and I should be done.

- <time>Mar 10, 2022</time> So, I've stumbled on to the weird world of [security headers](https://securityheaders.com/). Not sure if that was a mistake or not but regardless I'll be doing more research and making sure I can get all the check marks on [SecurityHeaders.com](https://securityheaders.com/).

- <time>Mar 09, 2022</time> Going to implement [Helmet.js](https://helmetjs.github.io/) and other security features before I seriously consider putting bettermailto on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/).

- <time>Mar 08, 2022</time> [Dismissed a dependency issue](https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere/issues/254#issuecomment-659037020).

- <time>Mar 07, 2022</time> I was wondering how I would fix the responsiveness of the providers (if your device was too wide, it would look awful) and my answer was right under my nose. I used `margin-left: auto` and `margin-right: auto` for the `@media` query when I should have just used it for all devices!

- <time>Mar 06, 2022</time> Got started with fixing the responsiveness of the website.

- <time>Mar 05, 2022</time> Fixed a very small glitch fix where the GitHub link was pointing to [my fork](https://github.com/y-arjun-y/bettermailto) rather than the GitHub organisation. Wondering what to work on next.

- <time>Mar 04, 2022</time> Implemented the compromise with [this NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/copy-to-clipboard).

- <time>Mar 03, 2022</time> Still working on implementing it, copy and pasting with JS (for all devices) is unnecessarily hard.

- <time>Mar 02, 2022</time> Okay, the first part of the decision chart won't work as you can change your default provider on iOS. So I'm directly using the compromise. Nearly done implementing it.

- <time>Mar 01, 2022</time> Alright, I still need to do a bit more research, but I think this "decision chart" should work:

  Is the device a phone? -> Is the device an iOS device? -> Use mailto.

  Is the device NOT a phone? -> Is the device a Mac-based computer? -> Compromise and just open the Apple Mail app and copy and paste the email and subject to the user's clipboard.

  I won't display the Apple Mail provider for non-Apple devices as I'm pretty sure Apple Mail isn't supported on Windows or on Android.

- <time>Feb 28, 2022</time> Committed the [Airmail](https://airmailapp.com) provider. I'm really unhappy with the Apple Mail provider, it relies on mailto and, if you've already set a default provider, it'll just open that instead of Apple Mail. I'll work on that from tomorrow and try to see if I can get some compromise (remember, the URL scheme for Apple Mail doesn't allow you to compose).

- <time>Feb 27, 2022</time> Committed the Spark provider.

- <time>Feb 26, 2022</time> Alright I figured out that [Spark has a pretty good URL scheme](https://talk.automators.fm/t/which-ios-email-apps-support-automation-shortcuts-url-schemes-x-callback-url/3552) (and people actually use Spark!) so I'm in the process of implementing that.

- <time>Feb 25, 2022</time> Removed the GitHub provider, going to work on adding more email providers that have a protocol handler.

- <time>Feb 24, 2022</time> Sigh, the GitHub provider is also useless since it requires the user to have their email public (which defeats one of the core values of bettermailto, keeping the email private from bad guys), I'll research about GitHub OAuth again tomorrow.

- <time>Feb 22, 2022</time> Removed the Slack provider since it was pretty useless (the person probably signed into Slack with a magic link or Google, both of which are already providers on bettermailto) and so I'll add GitHub tomorrow and leave it at that.

- <time>Feb 21, 2022</time> Got started with adding the [Slack](https://slack.com) provider (though it's broken right now) and going to add a GitHub provider as the final (?) OAuth provider.

- <time>Feb 20, 2022</time> Wasn't able to make much progress with the Apple Mail problem. The only real way is to use `mailto` so I've added that and I'll come back to it later.

- <time>Feb 19, 2022</time> Really strange, `message://` opens Apple Mail but it doesn't allow you to compose to any particular email.

- <time>Feb 18, 2022</time> Added fallbacks for the mobile providers! I'll work on trying to get Apple and Windows Mail (though I'm not entirely sure if that's possible).

- <time>Feb 17, 2022</time> Added the URL schemes for the three major email providers. Pretty interesting story:

  I first thought that a link from a website to a native app (that you didn't program) would be impossible (it makes sense security-wise) but nope, I (by sheer luck) found [googlemail](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29655978/is-there-an-ios-mail-scheme-url-for-googles-inbox).

  I fear this technology might be killed off by these big companies (I'm looking at you, [Google](https://killedbygoogle.com/)) but we'll cross that bridge when we get to it.

  Going to work on how to give the user more choice on whether they want to use the mobile app or the website.

- <time>Feb 16, 2022</time> Added the Outlook URL scheme!

- <time>Feb 15, 2022</time> Figured it out! Should be able to do it with the other providers (hopefully).

- <time>Feb 14, 2022</time> Figuring out how to add a link to open the Gmail app on iOS (for now).

- <time>Feb 13, 2022</time> Finished adding a fallback mailto provider. I couldn't keep the cool "Loading..." since it would be too much work to keep squashing bugs for various platforms for this small comfort feature.

- <time>Feb 12, 2022</time> Made great progress with adding the new providers!

- <time>Feb 11, 2022</time> Made a few miscellaneous changes (and committed them) and continued with adding other providers.

- <time>Feb 10, 2022</time> Made a really nice dropdown with CSS for the other providers. Why am I so good at CSS? I could have been good at literally any other skill (just kidding, CSS is amazing if you know how to use it).

- <time>Feb 09, 2022</time> Did a bunch of organizational work (updated the legal docs with the new support bettermailto-link, removed a test account on MongoDB and added an error page for NextAuth errors). I'll work on adding more sign-in providers and more email choices till probably March or April.

- <time>Feb 08, 2022</time> AHAHA I DID IT! I expected this to take a few days but nope, fixed everything (including an annoying button glitch) and you can now email me (safely, for both of us) with [this](https://www.bettermailto.com/user/620278e0561f820009d840d2).

- <time>Feb 07, 2022</time> Still working on the production glitch.

- <time>Feb 06, 2022</time> Okay, I had to comprise and remove any reference to the user's name. Now, the email provider works in production, but not in deployment. Going to fix that tomorrow.

- <time>Feb 05, 2022</time> I fixed another glitch where I queried the database with the user's name, not the ID (which was dumb). Still figuring out how to get the user's name into the database via the email provider.

- <time>Feb 04, 2022</time> Okay, I got the form looking pretty good and I figured out why the email sign-in wasn't working. My code relies on the name attribute the user provides (through OAuth) for the user URL. But since I didn't ask for their name using the email form, the whole code broke.

  So I need to find a way to manually add the name attribute to MongoDB (since I don't think NextAuth's email API allows that).

- <time>Feb 02, 2022</time> Going to keep the database issue aside right now, currently working on making the email form look much better.

- <time>Feb 01, 2022</time> Hmm, I noticed that new users face an error while signing in with the new provider, so I tried to add a MongoDB adapter and that broke everything... Will try to fix it tomorrow.

- <time>Jan 31, 2022</time> Finished adding the email provider! Pretty darn cool, though the UI is the opposite of cool right now. I'll work on that tomorrow.

- <time>Jan 30, 2022</time> So close to finishing all of this! I figured out that you have to use a dedicated service (not just Gmail) such as [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com).

- <time>Jan 28, 2022</time> Made great progress with adding the passwordless provider, though we may be in here for a while...

- <time>Jan 26, 2022</time> Got started with adding a [passwordless provider](https://next-auth.js.org/providers/email).

- <time>Jan 25, 2022</time> Forgot to add reCAPTCHA to the privacy policy, oops. Also added a disclaimer while signing in/up.

- <time>Jan 24, 2022</time> Finished (?) the privacy policy.

- <time>Jan 23, 2022</time> Got started with the privacy policy of bettermailto.

- <time>Jan 22, 2022</time> Finished with the terms of service.

- <time>Jan 21, 2022</time> Continued with the terms of service.

- <time>Jan 19, 2022</time> Continued with the terms of service.

- <time>Jan 18, 2022</time> Continued with the terms and conditions (and I'm pretty sure it has to be terms of service, but I'll check that tomorrow).

- <time>Jan 16, 2022</time> Got started with adding the terms and conditions.

- <time>Jan 15, 2022</time> Added a spinning animation to show while the website gets the reCAPTCHA score.

- <time>Jan 14, 2022</time> I'll keep credentials in the back of my mind, but for now I'll be adding some more easier-to-implement features (responsiveness, third party providers, changing the default providers depending on the device, etc.) For now, I'm working on responsiveness.

- <time>Jan 13, 2022</time> Still thinking about the Credentials provider.

- <time>Jan 12, 2022</time> Got started with adding the ["Credentials" provider to NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/providers/credentials). We might be at this for a while...

- <time>Jan 11, 2022</time> Fixed a long-standing bug where your custom link would be too long on mobile (also, this marks the first time my commit broke the website!) I'll work on more login clients from tomorrow.

- <time>Jan 10, 2022</time> Committed a [404 page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404) and some other smaller changes.

- <time>Jan 09, 2022</time> Committed the reCAPTCHA changes!

- <time>Jan 08, 2022</time> I finally got reCAPTCHA v3 working and verified! I just need to implement [this](https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere) locally and deploy it.

- <time>Jan 07, 2022</time> Verification is really tough for some reason, I keep getting CORS errors which is annoying. I'll push on tomorrow (and I'll figure out if I can do anything with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) or maybe even [PHP](https://www.php.net/))

- <time>Jan 06, 2022</time> Finally got reCAPTCHA v3 to work, the issue was me being dumb (should have just read the documentation). I need to program the verification tomorrow.

- <time>Jan 05, 2022</time> reCAPTCHA v3 with this [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-google-recaptcha-v3) is still not working for me and I'm not even sure why. I'll keep trying tomorrow and maybe try doing it in [React](https://reactjs.org).

- <time>Jan 04, 2022</time> Okay okay, reCAPTCHA v3 makes more sense, and I've got the functionality (almost) working.

- <time>Jan 03, 2022</time> Okay, [reCAPTCHA v2](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/display) makes a lot more sense now that I think about it, so I added it (still not functional) and styled it.

- <time>Jan 02, 2022</time> Got to work on adding [reCAPTCHA v3](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/v3) on the website to deliver on the promise of security for the emails. Also added meta tags and other small fixes.

- <time>Jan 01, 2022</time> [bettermailto is now live!](https://bettermailto.com) Though you cannot sign in right now, it's not a bug it's a feature... I also figured out how to deploy it all for free even within an organisation, I just have to fork it to my personal account and fetch it every time I make a commit.

- <time>Dec 31, 2021</time> Last day of 2021! I bought the domain [bettermailto.com](https://bettermailto.com) and I created the test email [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) integration. Hoping to [find a way to deploy from a GitHub organisation for free with AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/) and to get everything done and deployed by mid-2022!

- <time>Dec 30, 2021</time> Authenticating + generating URLs for multiple users is now done! Wow, that took a while. I'll work on other ways of signing in.

- <time>Dec 29, 2021</time> I figured out how to work with multiple users for generating the URLs, but authenticating them is still in the works.

- <time>Dec 28, 2021</time> Okay, back to programming. Got a major breakthrough and now I am able to authenticate the user URLs and generate them, but it only works with one user in the collection. Need to figure out how to get multiple users to work.

- <time>Dec 27, 2021</time> Reflecting about the project in a bigger sense and wondering what's next (again, in a bigger sense).

- <time>Dec 26, 2021</time> [Found another good piece on MongoDB and Next.js](https://www.techomoro.com/how-to-connect-mongodb-atlas-with-a-next-js-app/), made good progress with authenticating if the user already exists.

- <time>Dec 25, 2021</time> Connected everything! That video really came in clutch.

- <time>Dec 24, 2021</time> Started with my MongoDB setup, [found a good video to connect all of these parts together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6LoiRHRQzA), will watch it tomorrow and follow along.

- <time>Dec 23, 2021</time> Fixed some small bugs, still thinking about databases.

- <time>Dec 22, 2021</time> Fixed the "emailbox"'s styling and responsiveness. All I need to do now is make the whole app secure and connect it to a database.

- <time>Dec 21, 2021</time> Re-did the "emailbox" part of the app as the styling was messed up.

- <time>Dec 20, 2021</time> I feel like I still have a lot to learn about databases, back-end, user auth and even web security. It all feels quite overwhelming. Anyways, continued with checking if the user already exists.

- <time>Dec 19, 2021</time> I figured it out! I was looking at the problem of checking if a user already exists the wrong way, I simply need to assign a random string and link it to a database.

- <time>Dec 17, 2021</time> Wish I had more time to work on bettermailto today, but anyhow, worked on making the design more responsive.

- <time>Dec 16, 2021</time> That article didn't turn out all that useful, still figuring out how all this back-end stuff works. As for now, I added the email providers for the user URL slug.

- <time>Dec 15, 2021</time> More progress, found [a great article](https://towardsdatascience.com/tutorial-mongodb-user-authentication-with-google-sign-in-fcc13076799f) for connecting AWS, [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com) and Google Cloud all together, now I need to figure out how to store new users, and [I think I found an answer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRCh6mSSsb8).

- <time>Dec 14, 2021</time> Made good progress with the checking if a user already exists.

- <time>Dec 13, 2021</time> Migrated to [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) and cleared up old projects on Firebase and [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com) to keep everything organized.

- <time>Dec 12, 2021</time> Made the button have a cool transition, will work on getting user data from Google OAuth tomorrow.

- <time>Dec 11, 2021</time> After one [googolplex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googolplex), I finally made a custom page for signing in with Google OAuth + NextAuth!

- <time>Dec 10, 2021</time> Trying to figure out how to have a custom page for the Google OAuth.

- <time>Dec 09, 2021</time> Finally got [Google OAuth](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/sign-in) working.

- <time>Dec 07, 2021</time> Alright, starting to finally figure out all of this user auth stuff.

- <time>Dec 06, 2021</time> Why is user authentication so complicated?

- <time>Dec 05, 2021</time> [NextAuth](https://next-auth.js.org) + auth0 is really annoying, nothing seems to work. Thinking about going back to [AWS Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/). (I would leave it aside, but I can't leave user auth aside because it ties into generating custom URL's and making sure that URL actually exists.)

- <time>Nov 30, 2021</time> Nearly got auth0 working. I think working consistently on a project for slightly over a month is a good sign that things will work out.

- <time>Nov 29, 2021</time> In the process of migrating to [auth0](https://auth0.com/), it's much more user friendly (let's see if I regret this decision later on).

- <time>Nov 28, 2021</time> I'm going to keep the custom sign-in page aside for now. I need to figure out how to check if a user already exists within the user pool.

- <time>Nov 27, 2021</time> Got a comment on my Stack Overflow question that showed me [the solution](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/pages) to my problem!

- <time>Nov 26, 2021</time> Opened up [a Stack Overflow question about a custom UI with AWS Cognito + NextAuth.js](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70127769/how-do-i-make-a-custom-ui-for-nextauth-js-with-aws-cognito)

- <time>Nov 25, 2021</time> Fixed a small bug with the email box component. Also, the package I mentioned yesterday failed to install. But, [I've made another breakthrough with making the sign-up process more streamlined](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/issues/638).

- <time>Nov 24, 2021</time> Researched about [API's for AWS, I think I found my answer](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-js)!

- <time>Nov 23, 2021</time> Made some great progress. I figured out the second problem and found a way to create custom URLs. Now I have to start seriously thinking about databases and integrating them with [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/).

- <time>Nov 22, 2021</time> Continued with the dashboard of the app, it's all coming together!

- <time>Nov 21, 2021</time> So much progress today! Got done with the sign-in experience (it's not the best, but it works and it's more streamlined) and I am starting to think about databases for this app.

- <time>Nov 20, 2021</time> Continued with user authentication.

- <time>Nov 19, 2021</time> Got user authentication working, though I'm wondering how to make a custom UI for it.

- <time>Nov 18, 2021</time> Got great advice on the back-end infrastructure for bettermailto. Working on user authentication and fixed a small responsive glitch.

- <time>Nov 17, 2021</time> Finished the migration! Just need to fix the Netlify errors and it'll be deployed soon.

- <time>Nov 16, 2021</time> Making progress on the transfer, just have to figure out images in Next.js.

- <time>Nov 15, 2021</time> Going back to Square-1.

- <time>Nov 14, 2021</time> Okay, forget what I said yesterday. It's a lot more complicated.

- <time>Nov 13, 2021</time> Continued the migration, a bit more complicated but it's all good.

- <time>Nov 12, 2021</time> Continued the migration to Next.js and TypeScript.

- <time>Nov 11, 2021</time> In the process of migrating bettermailto to [Next.js](https://nextjs.com) to [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

- <time>Nov 10, 2021</time> Figured out how to confirm passwords.

- <time>Nov 09, 2021</time> We're making progress again! Found something called [Formik for React](https://formik.org/). I used it for the sign-up form.

- <time>Nov 08, 2021</time> Fixed the npm glitch.

- <time>Nov 07, 2021</time> Well crap, my repository has some weird [npm](https://npmjs.com) glitch and now I cannot start it.

- <time>Nov 06, 2021</time> Added some flex properties to make both the logo and log-in link visible on any device.

- <time>Nov 05, 2021</time> The front-end looks, in my very biased opinion, pretty great. But, there is literally nothing in the back-end. I started to add the registration code.

- <time>Nov 04, 2021</time> Creating a hamburger menu is too hard, decided to just add a link for mobile users to sign-up in the log-in page. Also fixed [Netlify](https://netlify.com) glitches and added other minor design changes.

- <time>Nov 03, 2021</time> Redesigned the sign-up and log-in pages and changed the Outlook link to be much faster.

- <time>Nov 02, 2021</time> Added a [(totally not stolen)](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_register_form.asp) sign up form (don't worry, I'll change it later).

- <time>Oct 30, 2021</time> Designing a form is hard.

- <time>Oct 29, 2021</time> Fixed the [React glitch with Switch](https://reactrouter.com/), and made a (very bad) sign up page. I think I will eventually need someone to handle the back-end part of this app.

#### Log

- <time>Mar 01, 2022</time> Last week done! We went around and told our next steps and it was awesome hearing that everyone found the program to be excellent :)

- <time>Feb 22, 2022</time> Seventh week done! We chose Global Catastrophic Biorisks and we discussed that in tandem with A.I. safety.

- <time>Feb 15, 2022</time> Sixth week done! We chose Decision Theory and had a great time discussing about [Brian Tomasik's work](https://reducing-suffering.org/why-maximize-expected-value/), [Pascal's mugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_mugging), [expected value](https://conceptually.org/concepts/expected-value), etc!

- <time>Feb 08, 2022</time> Fifth week done! We chose Using Forecasting Tools (which was surprising to me) and we talked a lot about [Metaculus](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/?show-welcome=true), [Scott Alexander](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/) and how to use forecasting in order to propel EA further.

- <time>Feb 01, 2022</time> Fourth week done! We chose Community Building and had a great time discussing some core concepts of how EA information is spread (and how to do that effectively) and we even touched upon EA in communities where it's not so present, such as South America.

- <time>Jan 25, 2022</time> Third week done! Had a great time discussing a lot about [Julia Galef's work (including The Scout Mindset, which I'm currently reading)](https://juliagalef.com/) and about applied rationality, biases and if the ends justify the means. A lot of this can be learnt about on [LessWrong](https://lesswrong.com/).

- <time>Jan 18, 2022</time> Second week done! Was even better than the last week, we talked a lot about animal welfare, [wild animal suffering](https://longtermrisk.org/the-importance-of-wild-animal-suffering/), the [expanding moral circle](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/4/4/18285986/robot-animal-nature-expanding-moral-circle-peter-singer), etc.

- <time>Jan 11, 2022</time> First week done! Was a lot of fun meeting my cohort, they all have such interesting backgrounds and goals for this fellowship.

- <time>Dec 30, 2021</time> Finished a lot of administrative stuff.

- <time>Dec 29, 2021</time> Had a fun training session where we all got roles to play, the best one I got was "look super confused at jargon".

#### Log

- <time>Jan 24, 2022</time> Alright, got rejected from arXiv again. My advisor suggested finding some other math archives. Honestly, with the exception of [ViXra](https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/105518/what-are-the-differences-between-vixra-org-and-arxiv-org#:~:text=Warranted%20or%20not,a%20bad%20reputation.) (which I won't go with, see link for reason) there aren't any pre-print repositories that aren't affiliated with a university.

  In the end, I had a lot of fun with this project! The link to the paper on Google Drive is [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10amLeqLfCtTacSXVoJMn97ktD5njTa39/view?usp=sharing) and I also cold emailed the inspiration for the paper.

- <time>Jan 23, 2022</time> Okay, resubmitted the paper with external figures and top 99 and top 100 results instead of no results.

- <time>Jan 22, 2022</time> I got the pie charts as external figures and crossed my fingers while processing the files on arXiv, well, it didn't time out, rather it gave an odd error saying something along the lines of "couldn't read the log file generated". It all works with the file without the appendix. Will look into all of this tomorrow.

- <time>Jan 21, 2022</time> Well, they sort of rejected my appeal for a large submission. Anyways, I timed my local compile time for the paper with the appendix and (accounting for slowness due to arXiv compiling it), I feel like if I change the pie charts to be external images, it may just be fast enough to beat the 420s time limit. Will see tomorrow.

  Otherwise, I'll jettison the four witness results.

- <time>Jan 20, 2022</time> Implementing tables in such a strict time limit looks impossible. So, I've contacted arXiv to allow a LaTeX generated PDF once again.

- <time>Jan 19, 2022</time> My general advice after rejection is to re-group, so here are the steps I'm going to follow in the following week (after speaking with my advisor):

  i) Try to fit all the results within the paper, this is going to be the hardest part as arXiv has a limit on the compile time. If I can't do this, I'll contact support and ask if to allow LaTeX generated PDF's (which they did last time)

  ii) Emphasise the exclusivity of these results as to my knowledge, the worst witnesses have never been published.

  iii) Try to add some real-world applications in the conclusion.

- <time>Jan 18, 2022</time> Well, my paper got rejected by the moderators, the worst part is that they can't give specific feedback due to so many submissions. I'll try again soon (after adding the results back in and talking with some advisors).

- <time>Jan 14, 2022</time> I did it! The paper has been submitted, should be public by Jan 16th at 8pm EST.

- <time>Jan 13, 2022</time> Facing a bit of a crossroads, I'm **this** close to being able to submit, but there's a lot of issues that need to be sorted out to make it perfect:

  i) What method do I take in showcasing the results? I could keep it in a tabular form (which was what I was planning to do) but the compile time is too long (and though the mods made an exception for me, it'll probably still get rejected) or I could just keep it as a link. Ancillary files don't seem to help that much.

  ii) There's a weird glitch where the references have this line break issue if the link is too long, might be able to fix this tomorrow.

- <time>Jan 12, 2022</time> I got endorsed! I was just about to finalize my submission but my paper is too long for arXiv due to the results, I sent an exception request and learnt that I have to put them in [ancillary files](https://arxiv.org/help/ancillary_files) for submission.

- <time>Jan 11, 2022</time> Continued finding endorsement.

- <time>Jan 10, 2022</time> Continued finding endorsement.

- <time>Jan 09, 2022</time> Fixed a small bug in the version of my paper with the appendix (which is the one I'll submit) and continued finding endorsement.

- <time>Jan 08, 2022</time> Got a final check done and trying to find someone to endorse me for the [math.NT section of arXiv](https://arxiv.org/list/math.NT/recent).

- <time>Jan 07, 2022</time> Finished all the changes, should be up on arXiv between today and the 9th.

- <time>Jan 06, 2022</time> Great progress with the first algorithm and some extra formatting. Will finish up the second and last algorithm tomorrow and make sure everything is neat and tidy. I'll do a bit more research on submission and (possibly) submit it to arXiv either tomorrow or the day after.

- <time>Jan 05, 2022</time> Alright, need to re-write the two pseudo-code algorithms, check everything and get to work submitting the manuscript to different journals (and later, [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/)).

- <time>Jan 04, 2022</time> Continued with re-formatting the paper and researching about journals and conferences.

- <time>Jan 03, 2022</time> Got the review back and got some great tips (mainly in formatting) and I implemented most of them (using the [algorithm](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Algorithms) package, fixing the heading position and fixing the conclusion).

- <time>Jan 02, 2022</time> Fixed that odd reference glitch, it was due to me deleting the output files...

- <time>Dec 31, 2021</time> Added references for the appendix, my goal for 2022 is, well, to get this published! There is also some weird glitch happening with the references right now, but I'll fix that soon.

- <time>Dec 30, 2021</time> Finished the first draft and sent it for review! I got all the packages installed and got a 90-page paper, though most of those pages are just the worst witnesses in a tabular form.

- <time>Dec 29, 2021</time> The paper is basically done, I need to check everything (grammar & spelling and general writing while still in Overleaf), add a few more references and compile everything with [BasicTex](https://tug.org/mactex/morepackages.html).

- <time>Dec 28, 2021</time> Added the rest of the results and analyzed the single witness results, need to analyze the rest, somehow compile the Latex document another way ([Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) isn't having it with my top 500 worst witnesses), add concluding remarks and we're done.

- <time>Dec 27, 2021</time> Added the results for single and two witnesses, going to add the rest tomorrow as well as some data visualization for all of them tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.

- <time>Dec 26, 2021</time> Made good progress and finished the code and multiple witnesses section! All that is left is results analysis and conclusions.

- <time>Dec 25, 2021</time> Finished the introduction to the test, will work on the code used (and how I supported multiple witnesses) and maybe even analyzing the single witness results tomorrow.

- <time>Dec 24, 2021</time> Got a nice and simple template and finished the abstract for the most part. Will work on the introduction to the test and its witnesses tomorrow.

- <time>Dec 23, 2021</time> Started with the paper, [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) is an amazing piece of software.

- <time>Dec 22, 2021</time> Compiled the three and four witnesses results, wished I could have started writing but oh well.

- <time>Dec 21, 2021</time> Compiled the two witnesses results.

- <time>Dec 20, 2021</time> Compiled the single witness results and cleaned up the research file.

- <time>Dec 19, 2021</time> Finished coding up 3 and 4 witnesses, will save the results up to about 10,000 (I don't have heat death of the universe level of time to spend) and start writing the paper soon.

- <time>Dec 18, 2021</time> I did it! The worst multiple witnesses of the Miller-Rabin primality test are now knowable through my very slow code! I'll start writing the paper soon after compiling all my results.

- <time>Dec 17, 2021</time> I'm going the extra mile and trying to figure out the worst liars when they are grouped as 2 witnesses (if I can get this, it'll probably be similar to do 3, 4 or more witnesses, but there's no need to go over 4 I believe).

- <time>Dec 16, 2021</time> Fixed the glitch for single witnesses! I can now get the top liars! The 2nd worst witness for defendants till 1000 is 676, with 18 lies.

- <time>Dec 15, 2021</time> Amazing progress! I implemented multiple witnesses into the test, I should have done this a long time ago but I thought it was going to be hard/complicated, but it wasn't. I also spent way too long fixing a glitch.

- <time>Dec 14, 2021</time> It now works, sort of? It's hard to tell. I'll now analyze my two methods (possibly three now that I think about it), fix any bugs and see if I can get in contact with an actual college student in maths before starting to write my paper.

- <time>Dec 13, 2021</time> Coded it up, and while it is just about the same speed as the last method, it doesn't work, at all. Might need to fix that soon.

- <time>Dec 12, 2021</time> Figured out a (hopefully) better methodology to use and wrote it down in comments, though it may be even slower than the previous one. Still, what matters is the results.

- <time>Dec 11, 2021</time> Alright so, I'm going to keep my previous methodology as a separate cell. I'll work on another approach (that's a bit more useful) tomorrow. I might need to reach out to someone to check if all of this actually works and makes sense.

- <time>Dec 10, 2021</time> So I thought my methodology was pretty good, turns out that I always get 1 as the worst witness. I'll take a bit of time out to figure out a different methodology.

- <time>Dec 09, 2021</time> Made good progress with finding the worst witness, crazy to think that a random line in a Numberphile video lead to all of this.

- <time>Dec 08, 2021</time> Migrated to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) and made some progress on calculating star liars. I need to figure out multiple witnesses, I know one way but it'll make everything incredibly slow.

- <time>Dec 07, 2021</time> Even more progress! I created a few more functions, mainly for primes numbers (not sure how useful the composite functions will be) and I need to find a quicker way to accurately find the number of prime numbers between two given numbers.

- <time>Dec 06, 2021</time> Progress! I explored the function for the Miller-Rabin test and created some composite functions and figured out how to use custom witnesses.

- <time>Dec 05, 2021</time> Thinking of moving to [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) because of the existence of this [crate](https://docs.rs/miller_rabin/latest/miller_rabin/).

- <time>Dec 01, 2021</time> Changed to [Python](https://python.org) since it's much easier to work with. Going to have to figure out how to generate star-witnesses and work my way to liars.

- <time>Nov 30, 2021</time> [Opened up a repository](https://github.com/y-arjun-y/liars-miller-rabin) for the Miller-Rabin C code. Let's hope December is a good month for this project!

- <time>Nov 29, 2021</time> Researched about the star witnesses in the Miller-Rabin test (see Numberphile video).

- <time>Nov 28, 2021</time> Wrote up my [Notion](https://notion.so) page with the basics of the test, hoping to write some code for the test in [C/C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_C-family_programming_languages) (haven't decided) by the end of this week.

### <span id="note">Note</span>

I define a project as anything I am actively building, creating or participating in. I don't count my content and schoolwork as projects. One-off tasks (such as updating documentation or fixing a small glitch for a previous project) also don't count.

Any gaps between logs does not mean that I worked on the project in between, any work done for the project will be logged (unless any special circumstance occurs).

I put links to jargon, tools I use, or anything I think would be cool to read more about! But please note that, unless explicitly stated, I was never paid to mention the link.

I may make spelling, grammar or factual mistakes. I'll probably notice them at the end of my day. If I don't, [contact me](https://bettermailto.com/user/620278e0561f820009d840d2).

For privacy reasons, I don't mention others who may have worked with me on these projects (unless I asked them first or their role was public), some projects with their logs may come later and I may also come off a bit vague at times.

There'll be a lot of exceptions in this note (with many more spelling and grammar mistakes), but regardless, I hope you find these logs inspiring!
