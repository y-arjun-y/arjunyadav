**2023** was both deeply enriching and challenging year, and in a feeling I'm sure isn't uncommon to many high school seniors, the year doesn't feel over yet. I'll leave this reflection with a quote:

> People have got to let their bodies breathe a little bit more. That's the great thing about being a pompous, jumped-up rock god. There's plenty of air around you. - Robert Plant
