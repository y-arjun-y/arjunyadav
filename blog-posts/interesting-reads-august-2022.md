I log everything I read in Notion. This month I read 2 books, 36 newsletters and 10 articles.

Here are some of the highlights of this month!

## Books

- [The Almanack of Naval Ravikant](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55359713-the-almanack-of-naval-ravikant) by Eric Jorgenson - I did not particularly enjoy this book: maybe it was the formating of the book, maybe it was the fact that someone other than Naval himself compiled Naval's thoughts and lessons, but this book felt contradictory many times. The first quarter or so was somewhat enjoyable.
- [80,000 Hours](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33229792-80-000-hours) - A great condensation of 80,000 Hours' research, though it is starting to show its age. If you want to keep up with their research, [check out their (excellent) website](https://80000hours.org/).

## Newsletters

- Lots of buzz in "the EA sphere" thanks to [Will MacAskill's new book: What We Owe The Future](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/59802037). If there was one post to take away from all of this buzz, it might just be [this Future Perfect issue](https://link.vox.com/view/60fc3142c9f14776313e8c4ah5kvl.1aem/d3d7db2f).

## Articles

- [The Thin Line Between Bold and Reckless](https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/the-thin-line-between-bold-and-reckless/) is a great (excerpt?) from Morgan Housel's excellent book (that I'm currently re-reading), [The Psychology of Money](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51181015-the-psychology-of-money).

- [A well-written post about cars and the environment](https://herman.bearblog.dev/thoughts-on-buying-a-car/) from the creator of Bear Blog.
