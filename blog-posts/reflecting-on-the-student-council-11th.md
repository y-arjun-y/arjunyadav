As I exit my junior year of high school, I'm grateful to have gotten a taste of what true leadership looks like: after coordinating numerous events and being part of several more, I feel that I've learnt some valuable lessons that I wish to document and share here.

### Lesson 1 - Your event is only as good as its documents are.

Out of the countless things you'll have to organise for an event - documents are vital.

As I was organising my first open mic for my school's environment club, I learnt that having a mental note of all your documents and making sure they're available at a moment's notice is critical for a smooth flow. A whole event can get cancelled just because of incompetence with documents.

Always keep your documents organised.

### Lesson 2 - Designing Instagram posts

I'm somewhat unique in my school, and one of the contributing factors to that is my relationship with Instagram. I do have a few accounts for clubs and projects that I manage, e.g.: [SOLARIS](https://instagram.com/solaris.dpss) but I do not have a personal one (nor a spam one!).

Yet, I strongly believe that, regardless of your role in an event, **you must achieve mastery in at least having a feel for what good social media posts look like** (even better if you can learn to design them effectively!).

The best suite of tools for getting your head around social media (at least for me) has been [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) for designing in general and [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) as a poor man's Photoshop for photo editing.

### 'Lesson' 3 - Voice messages

Less of a lesson and more of something that I've realized: Previously, I had never used the voice message feature on WhatsApp. Besides not particularly liking the timbre of my voice, I always found it a waste of time for both ends of the message.

Well, that changes drastically when you're constantly leading something. Suddenly, it became less of a waste of time from your end to send voice messages.

I'm not exactly sure at what point in time did WhatsApp allow you to control the speed of a voice message - but to the development team that must have worked tirelessly on that feature, thank you.
