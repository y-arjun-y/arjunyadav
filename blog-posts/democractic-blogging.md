meta_description: Mirror is a publishing platform based on $WRITE. It is not like Medium or even Bear Blog, you don't just create an account and start writing. No $WRITE coins = No writing.

## An Analogy

Cricket is the [second-most popular](https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/what-are-the-most-popular-sports-in-the-world.html) sport on the planet. Millions of people tune in to watch the [ICC World Cup](https://www.cricketworldcup.com/) every 4 years and the [IPL](https://www.iplt20.com/) every year.

Both of these use shorter formats of the game, ODI and T20 respectively. These formats are quite new, [the first ODI match](http://static.espncricinfo.com/db/STATS/ODIS/MISC/COMPLETE_LIST.html) took place in 1971 and [the first T20 match](https://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/records/335433.html) took place in 2004.

The oldest and longest format of the game, Test cricket, was first played in 1877 and while it is debatable on whether it is actually dying or not, [even cricket legends agree that interest has gone down.](https://en.100mbsports.com/cant-disagree-that-peoples-interest-has-gone-down-but-no-way-is-test-cricket-dying-michael-holding-eng/)

This fits well with how content over the internet has evolved, going from long-form blog posts to YouTube to shorts on TikTok.

Obviously, writing on the internet isn't dying, but just like Test cricket, people's interest has gone down.

Is blogging on its way to being run out?

## Cryptocurrency and Democracy

[Mirror.xyz](https://mirror.xyz) is a publishing platform based on $WRITE. It is not like [Medium](https://medium.com) or even [Bear Blog](https://bearblog.dev), you don't just create an account and start writing. No $WRITE coins = No writing.

So, how do you get these $WRITE coins? You have to enter into their weekly quasi-political [race](https://mirror.xyz/race). You have to answer a simple question: "What would you like to use Mirror for?" and people vote for you.

Is this experiment in democracy working? Well, [one person answered the question with a "¯\_(ツ)\_/¯"](https://mirror.xyz/race?candidate=jzstern) and got 2000+ votes.

Jokes aside, Mirror looks very promising as a merger of blockchain and content and has definitely got me interested in learning about the crazy world of cryptocurrency and blockchain.
