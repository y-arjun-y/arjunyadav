I log everything I read in Notion. This month I read 1 book, 48 newsletters and 18 articles.

Here are some of the highlights of this month!

## Books

- [The Most Important Century by Holden Karnofsky](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59244207-the-most-important-century-blog-post-series) - This series of blog posts explains why the 21st century is the most important century for humanity. It takes a deep dive into the economic reasons why this is the most important century, digital people, transformative A.I. and the bio anchors method, among many other things. This book explains all these concepts clearly in a much less technical way, instead relying on examples, analogies and illustrations. I feel this **should be the first "LessWrong type" book recommended to new folk**.

## Newsletters

- [Dylan Matthews' write-up on Thomas Philippon's recent paper](https://link.vox.com/view/60fc3142c9f14776313e8c4aged5f.12t5/d446a241) on how [total factor productivity growth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_factor_productivity) could be linear was insightful and a bit worrying. [Here's the paper](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~tphilipp/papers/AddGrowth_macro.pdf).

## Articles

- Here's [an interesting story](https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/the-rich-and-the-wealthy/) by Morgan Housel on extreme wealth.

- Finally, we have [some interesting TV/movie ideas to portray existential risk](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/jsqTCrixFHEQsSTTj/13-ideas-for-new-existential-risk-movies-and-tv-shows-what) by Haydn Belfield.
