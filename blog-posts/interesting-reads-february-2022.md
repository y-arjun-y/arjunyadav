I log everything I read in Notion. This month I read 1 book, 51 newsletters and 13 articles.

Here are some of the highlights of this month!

## Books

- [The Scout Mindset by Julia Galef](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42041926-the-scout-mindset) - I guess this would count as my first book that would probably land on a [LessWrong](https://lesswrong.com) "must read" post. It's a great introduction to the world of applied rationality. The examples have a tendency to stick in your head (like Elon Musk saying he had a 90% chance of failure for Tesla) which really drill in the concepts well. If you're interested but not convinced by this quasi-review, [Julia has made the calibration exercise of her book available for free](https://juliagalef.com/calibration/).

## Newsletters

- [The hidden epidemic](https://link.vox.com/view/60fc3142c9f14776313e8c4afvvou.s6b/366f6821) by Future Perfect reminded me how scary antibiotic resistance is. [What are the Olympics for?](https://link.vox.com/view/60fc3142c9f14776313e8c4afu50r.18p4/35e1db9d) is another great piece, also by Future Perfect.

## Articles

- I'm heavily biased (as I proof-read, or "beta-read" these posts) but I loved [Future-proof ethics](https://www.cold-takes.com/future-proof-ethics/) and [Defending One-Dimensional Ethics](https://www.cold-takes.com/defending-one-dimensional-ethics/) by Holden Karnofsky, he has an incredible ability to explain such complex philosophical topics in a fun and captivating way.

- [We need 40000h or maybe even 20000h](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/8kGnkkLFWcbE22HYT/we-need-40000h-or-maybe-even-20000h) is a really interesting take on effective career advice that was on the EA Forum.

- [Big Skills](https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/skills/?utm_source=brainpint&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=big_skills&utm_term=2022-02-02) and [Lazy Work, Good Work](https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/lazy-work-good-work/) are both excellent pieces by Colab Fund.
