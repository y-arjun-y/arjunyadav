I log everything I read in Notion. This month I read 2 books, 47 newsletters and 21 articles.

Here are some of the highlights of this month!

## Books

- [Superintelligence by Nick Bostrom](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20527133-superintelligence) - This book is a deep-dive into the heart of the A.I. alignment problem and what might happen when we reach A.I. that is smarter than humans ([which is not too long](https://www.cold-takes.com/forecasting-transformative-ai-the-biological-anchors-method-in-a-nutshell/#:~:text=Bio%20Anchors%20estimates%20a%20%3E10%25%20chance%20of%20transformative%20AI%20by%202036%2C%20a%20~50%25%20chance%20by%202055%2C%20and%20an%20~80%25%20chance%20by%202100.)). It is very technical, but it sort of has to be to discuss such a vast and complex topic. Well worth the read.

- [Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11297044-steve-jobs) - Steve Jobs has always been an enigmatic figure for me. Even after reading this incredible biography, he still is. The main thing that I got out of this was the reminder that people and things are rarely black and white on the moral spectrum.

## Newsletters

- [This piece on Animal Welfare](https://link.vox.com/view/60fc3142c9f14776313e8c4ag1pvd.z91/c6213424) by Kenny Torrella has a really interesting investigation in the beginning.

- Nick deWilde's [Do we owe our careers to our country?](https://junglegym.substack.com/p/do-we-owe-our-careers-to-our-country) is a great exploration of the Japanese concept "Ikigai".

## Articles

- [EA should taboo "EA should"](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Pz7RdMRouZ5N5w5eE/ea-should-taboo-ea-should) is an interesting argument by Lizka, [the new content specialist at the Centre for Effective Altruism](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/aeR2Pses3TjWW8H9t/hello-from-the-new-content-specialist-at-cea).

- [AI Risk is like Terminator; Stop Saying it's Not](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/zsFCj2mfnYZmSW2FF/ai-risk-is-like-terminator-stop-saying-it-s-not-1) is a fun (and slightly light-hearted?) post on A.I. safety.
