I log everything I read in Notion. In these two months, I've read 5 newsletters and 3 articles.

Here are some of the highlights of this month!

## Newsletters

- Loved [this](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/tales-of-takeover-in-ccf-world?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email) Astral Codex Ten issue. I tend to like AI Safety pieces that are more story and scenario driven at first, and then are able to justify why the things happened int the scenario as they did.

## Articles

- It's funny how Sigal contrasts Sam Altman's statement with the average American's sentiment in [this](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/8/18/23836362/ai-slow-down-poll-regulation) Future Perfect piece.
