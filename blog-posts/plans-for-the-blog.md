It's been a while since I've made a non-series blog post (Jul 2023), and while I think I still have written a decent amount since then (mostly through really diligent note-taking during courses and projects), that hasn't been _writing_ writing. I find that my focus for writing is hard to come by, but once it does - there's not much stopping me from letting the words flow. 

I hope to now write weekly on this website of mine, I've blocked one hour for myself to write on Saturdays, I'm not sure what I'd expect the posts to look like: some of them will probably be about thoughts on AI (just because I consume a lot of AI related media throughout the week), but I don't really want to limit myself to a certain topic or even theme.

Until next time!
