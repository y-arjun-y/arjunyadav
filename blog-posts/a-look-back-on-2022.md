**2022** was, overall, a productive, happy, healthy and incredibly fulfilling year. This year had the esteemed honour of hosting so many of my greatest achievements thus far (all of which are available on [my project logs](/projects)). I learnt so many valuable life lessons this year (and made many more mistakes!) that I'm sure will come back to me via digging through my journal.

I want to end this look back with a small quote (which is often somewhat erroneously attributed to the former Member of Parliament whose statue I took a picture of early this year, Edmund Burke):

> The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.
