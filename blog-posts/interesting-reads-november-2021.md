I log everything I read in Notion. This month I have read 1 book, 48 newsletters and 16 (the same as last month!) articles.

Here are some of the highlights of this month!

## Books

- [Homo Deus by Yuval Noah Harari](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31138556-homo-deus?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=agFSKNVzny&rank=1) - This is the best book in his [trilogy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50847794-yuval-noah-harari-collection-3-books-set). [I think Andrej Karpathy's review sums up this book quite well](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1873660821?book_show_action=true&from_review_page=1).

## Newsletters

- [Collaborative Fund](https://www.collaborativefund.com/) (and their [blog posts](https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/), mostly by [Morgan Housel](https://twitter.com/morganhousel)) really stole this month. The sheer quality of their posts is unmatched. [Here's a really good piece](https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/experts/) that appeared in one of their newsletters.

- [Conceptually](https://conceptually.org/) does an excellent job teaching a complex topic every week in a simplified (but not oversimplified) form. [Here's a great piece for example](https://conceptually.org/concepts/signalling-and-countersignalling).

- [trms by Lorenzo Gravina](https://trms.me/) really speaks to me with its unique "generalist" view, [here's a good piece to get started with](https://trms.me/preparation/).

## Articles

- [Aaron Getler retired with this post on the EA Forum](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/aNKuzuQkpfyBLwqqv/announcing-my-retirement). I wish him good luck with everything he plans to do, it was such a joy to receive his EA Forum Digest and EA Newsletters.

- If you're suffering from a bit of eco-anxiety, [maybe this will help](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ckPSrWeghc4gNsShK/good-news-on-climate-change).
