I log everything I read in Notion. This month I read 1 book, 38 newsletters and 9 articles.

Here are some of the highlights of this month!

## Books

- [The Audacity of Hope by Barack Obama](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/9742) - Even though this book is more than 15 years old, it still feels _somewhat_ relevant to today's geopolitics. Chapter 9 is probably my favourite chapter. Obama's reflection on his relationship with Indonesia is superb and every opinion Obama writes about is elevated by just how great of a writer he is.

## Newsletters

- The LaMDA controversy in A.I. safety [was carefully dissected by Future Perfect](https://link.vox.com/view/60fc3142c9f14776313e8c4agpa0y.17fv/21172c1a) this month.

- I really like [Ali Abdaal's introduction to EA](https://aliabdaal.com/would-i-save-my-brother-from-a-burning-building/) on one of his issues this month.

## Articles

- [An interesting analysis of non-profit boards](https://www.cold-takes.com/nonprofit-boards-are-weird-2/) by Holden Karnofsky on his blog, Cold Takes.
