I log everything I read in Notion. This month I read 66 newsletters and 26 articles.

Here are some of the highlights of this month!

## Newsletters

- [Cold Takes](https://www.cold-takes.com/) by Holden Karnofsky is an excellent newsletter/website about EA, rationality, epistemology and literally everything in between. [Here's the piece that got me hooked](https://www.cold-takes.com/bet-with-zvi-about-omicron/).

- [Alignment Newsletter](https://rohinshah.com/alignment-newsletter/) is a really cool A.G.I./unaligned A.I. newsletter run by a UC Berkeley EAist. Though it is slightly more technical, I still recommend it due to the summaries that are provided.

## Articles

- I became heavily engrossed in [Mr. Money Mustache](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/) and in general the "financially independent, retire early" movement. Definitely recommend [this introductory post](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2013/02/22/getting-rich-from-zero-to-hero-in-one-blog-post/) and exploring the links provided.

- [Wait By Why](https://waitbutwhy.com) by Tim Urban is an excellent and funny blog site about literally everything, [here's a great piece to get started with](https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/12/11-awkward-things-about-email.html).
