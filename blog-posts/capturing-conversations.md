meta_description: How does one go about capturing conversations? Here's my attempt at answering that question.

Great conversations are far and few between, and [our memories might be a lot more faultier than we think](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28581302/), so it pays merit to try to preserve what we can, while we still can.

I've gradualy adopted a philosophy of dividing conversations into:

* Formal Conversations: Separate from my meeting notes divider in Notability, I have a "subject" (what Notability calls folders essentially) that is used to make quick notes (usually in bullet-point form, I find that I'm able to capture things quickly when I don't have to string together proper sentences) with a heavy use of quotes to get the main jist.

* Informal Conversations: My journal is the harbourer of a lot of wisdom that I get throughout daily living, though this isn't as consistent as I would like it to be (which is partly why I'm writing about this for this week), but one thing that has helped to consolidate this effort is by having a subject called "monthly recap" for both happy and insightful moments.

One day, I hope to smile while reading back at these, don't think enough time has passed for that to happen yet.
