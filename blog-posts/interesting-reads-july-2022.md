I log everything I read in Notion. This month I read 32 newsletters and 15 articles.

Here are some of the highlights of this month!

## Newsletters

- A fun one from Holden Karnofsky [discussing results from research on futurists](https://www.cold-takes.com/the-track-record-of-futurists-seems-fine/).

- [Alignment Newsletter by Rohin Shah is back](https://mailchi.mp/56689cc2223c/an-172-sorry-for-the-long-hiatus?e=a553903da3)!

- Some great issues from Future Perfect this month ([1](https://link.vox.com/view/60fc3142c9f14776313e8c4agy5sh.un5/d1f7109f), [2](https://link.vox.com/view/60fc3142c9f14776313e8c4agtexf.14nn/b6b57a15) and [3](https://link.vox.com/view/60fc3142c9f14776313e8c4agx3zp.txz/2ae14fec)).

## Articles

- I really like [this list of questions](https://patrickcollison.com/questions) from Patrick Collison. There's something about the minimal nature of his website that I dig.

- [This EA Forum post blew up](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/x9Rn5SfapcbbZaZy9/ea-for-dumb-people). Weirdly, I don't think it was mentioned on any of the EA Forum digests this month. Interesting.
