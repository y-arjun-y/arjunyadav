[I created a simple Notion template for creating personal predictions](https://arjun-0148901934ua31.notion.site/Predictions-17e585e3e6704d7da7a20b0524bf8797). You can set multiple reminders and even embed line charts showcasing the likelihood across time (though this does rely on [an external service](https://www.notion.vip/charts/)).

This was created pretty quickly, and the predictions in the template are just for demonstration purposes. [I would love to get feedback/suggestions](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/QAvNzPXHnyAPmg6aQ/notion-template-for-personal-predictions)!
