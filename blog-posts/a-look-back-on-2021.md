**2021 was and will always be an important year for me**, why? There are two reasons that I want to write about deeply here. I'll also have a reflection on what I accomplished this year and some aspirations for 2022.

## Reason 1: Productivity

Last year, **I fell into possibly the greatest rabbit hole I ever stumbled into, productivity channels**, with most of my consumption being from [Matt D'Avella](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJ24N4O0bP7LGLBDvye7oCA) and [Ali Abdaal](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoOae5nYA7VqaXzerajD0lg).

I learnt so many things about time management and how to get more done with the same amount of time (while still having fun and staying healthy).

**The most important video of them all was [this one by Matt D'Avella about tracking your time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUjTvPy_UAg)**, I decided to try it out in mid-2021, though it wasn't till **August 6th** that I consistently did it till this very day.

Tracking my time changed this whole year, **possibly my whole life**. I would have never been able to balance my school, [programming at EA Data](https://arjunyadav.net/projects#eadata), learning about EA and maintaining my hobbies: [playing the guitar](https://arjunyadav.net/projects#guitar), [cubing](https://arjunyadav.net/projects#cubing), [learning chess](https://arjunyadav.net/projects#chess), etc without it.

Other than that, [Focusmate](https://arjunyadav.net/150-focusmate-sessions), using [Todoist](https://todoist.com) and setting a goal of 20, and recently **25 tasks a day** and [tracking the projects I do](https://arjunyadav.net/projects) have all radically improved my productivity and general well-being.

## Reason 2: Effective Altruism

My brother learnt about [Effective Altruism](https://arjunyadav.net/what-is-effective-altruism) sometime before me, but he soon told me about it.

At first, I was slightly skeptical (probably because I didn't understand a good chunk of it). I joined [EA Cambridge's introductory fellowship](https://www.eacambridge.org/ea-fellowship-info) and got two books, [Doing Good Better](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23398748-doing-good-better) and [The Precipice](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48570420-the-precipice), with the former being so influential to me that [I wrote my capstone project for the fellowship about it](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11q6LWi_4G3_mmi39mjQogIKfby4nLPVngoAqYwxFHRk/edit?usp=sharing).

I started to truly believe in Effective Altruism, in the sense **that I believed it gave me a rational method to do the most good for the world**.

This led to the [EA Forum](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org), which lead to me randomly cold-emailing the owner of [Effective Altruism Data](https://effectivealtruismdata.com), showing [a random project I made about unemployment](https://y-arjun-y.github.io/youthree/) and asking if I could join as a programmer (which somehow worked!).

EA has given me a lot of clarity on my life and I'm so glad my brother shared that little segment of his knowledge with me.

## Some of my accomplishments in 2021

- I finished my unemployment project, [youthree](https://y-arjun-y.github.io/youthree).
- I finally stopped changing my website all the time and stuck with [Bear Blog](https://bearblog.dev), [started to log my projects](https://arjunyadav.net/projects/) and [curate the more interesting things I read every month](https://arjunyadav.net/interesting-reads/).
- I attended an introductory and [in-depth EA fellowship](https://arjunyadav.net/projects/#eaindepth) and [EA Global: London 2021](https://arjunyadav.net/projects/#eaglobal2021) (albeit online)
- Became a programmer for [EA Data](https://effectivealtruismdata.org) and did data visualization with my teammate for [Legal Priorities Project](https://www.legalpriorities.org/)!
- Became a facilitator for the Jan-Feb round of the aforementioned in-depth EA fellowship!
- Wrote a [maths research paper](https://arjunyadav.net/projects/#millerrabin) from a [Numberphile video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MscGSN5J6o).
- Generally became a lot more productive and dived much deeper into my hobbies and projects.

## Some aspirations for 2022

- Finish the maths research paper which I've already submitted for review. I hope to get it on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/), though a more ambitious (and unrealistic) goal is to get into a journal.
- Talk about EA to a large audience, which I hope to do in early 2022.
- Continue to be productive, happy, healthy and seek out opportunities!
