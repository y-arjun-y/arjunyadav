I recently got access to [DALL·E 2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/), OpenAI's triumphant image generation model. Here are two "essential readings": one on how it works and one comparing it other models. Now, here are some of my favourite results!

### Prompt: An astronaut crying while stranded on a desolate planet

Inspired by The Martian. This came out shockingly well. Up until now, DALL·E 2 could not get human faces right at all[^1] (which we'll see later on), but other than the glass dome for the helmet appearing to be missing and maybe portions of the astronaut's hand, this is perfect.

### Prompt: A cartoon of a fox band playing jazz
