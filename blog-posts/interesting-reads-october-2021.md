I log everything I read in Notion. This month I have read 2 books, 41 newsletters and 16 articles.

Here are some of the highlights of this month!

## Books

- [Money: The True Story of a Made-Up Thing](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54143001-money) by Jacob Goldstein - I got into this book via the Planet Money podcast, and while I wouldn't say it is a replacement to that podcast show, it isn't trying to be. Regardless, a good book on money, the history of money and cryptocurrency.

- [The Alignment Problem](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50489349-the-alignment-problem) by Brian Christian - A wonderfully in-depth book about the world of A.I., A.G.I and general A.I. safety. It is a bit in-depth, in my opinion, for anyone who wants just an introduction to this incredibly complicated field. Maybe I'll find a book fitting that criteria.

## Newsletters

- From [Future Perfect](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect), my favourite piece would definitely be "Cultivated meat might not save us", really opened my eyes to the criticisms and problems of cultivated meat. (I wish I could share it, but for some reason, sharing the link I got in my email leaks my email. I also cannot find it online.)
- Another great piece would be ["Stepping off a Rocketship. Strapping on a Jetpack."](https://junglegym.substack.com/p/stepping-off-a-rocketship-strapping) by Nick DeWilde in his excellent newsletter: [The Jungle Gym](https://junglegym.substack.com/).

## Articles

- [Beyond Smart](http://www.paulgraham.com/smart.html) by Paul Graham showed me how truly brilliant Paul Graham's writing is.
- If you're into something more laid-back, here's [a fun article about Roland McDonald](https://www.vice.com/en/article/v7ew98/what-happened-to-ronald-mcdonald) by Amelia Tait.
