I log everything I read in Notion. This month I read 48 newsletters and 17 articles.

Here are some of the highlights of this month!

## Newsletters

- There has been a lot of great Future Perfect issues this month, but if I had to choose two, it would be [Bryan Walsh on Quantum Computing](https://link.vox.com/view/60fc3142c9f14776313e8c4agiqh3.xdx/2830b1d1) and [Sigal Samuel on a cost-effective way to reduce violent crime](https://link.vox.com/view/60fc3142c9f14776313e8c4agke9r.y02/5d506daa).

## Articles and Papers

- [A Generalist Agent by DeepMind](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/A%20Generalist%20Agent/Generalist%20Agent.pdf), regardless of whether you believe it's [powerful enough to cause concern](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/TwfWTLhQZgy2oFwK3), is still a big deal. [Here's a non-technical explainer](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/4m69jEBWxrqnjyuZp/deepmind-s-generalist-ai-gato-a-non-technical-explainer).

- Mental health in Effective Altruism is something I find pretty interesting. [Here's the article in this month's 80,000 Hours newsletter that's just about that](https://80000hours.org/2022/04/imposter-syndrome/).
