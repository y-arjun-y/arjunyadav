I log everything I read in Notion. In these two months, I've read 2 books, 68 newsletters, 20 articles.

Here are some of the highlights of this month!

## Books

- [The Martian](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18007564-the-martian) by Andy Weir - A good science-fiction book. I don't have much criticism to add, other than the fact that I found myself being more interested with the characters around Mark Watney that Mark Watney himself. I guess that was intentional?
- [The Psychology of Money](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41881472-the-psychology-of-money?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_13) by Morgan Housel - A re-read for me, this was the first book I remember reading whilst trying to make reading a habit. I would highly recommend getting a feel for Colab Fund before diving in to the financial lessons this book offers (heck, you may find that most of the book is present on Colab Fund!)

## Newsletters

- The usual Future Perfect round-up: [open publishing in science](https://link.vox.com/view/60fc3142c9f14776313e8c4ahb5yq.wzh/1f147259) and [biorisk](https://link.vox.com/view/60fc3142c9f14776313e8c4ahijl5.15le/519706a8) for September and October respectively.

- I really liked [this month's Product Lessons issue](https://productlessons.substack.com/p/when-ambition-is-oppressive). Talks about ambition in a refreshing way.

## Articles

- [This post](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2018/01/amazon-mechanical-turk/551192/) by The Atlantic about [Amazon Mechanical Turk](https://www.mturk.com/) is the highlight of these two months.
