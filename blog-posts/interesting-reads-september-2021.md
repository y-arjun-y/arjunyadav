I log everything I read in Notion. This month I have read 3 books, 36 newsletters and 18 articles.

Here are some of the highlights of this month!

## Books

- [The Diary of a Young Girl](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48855.The_Diary_of_a_Young_Girl) by Anne Frank: This book is a rollercoaster of emotions, it is uplifting at how the human spirit can persevere through the toughest of times and depressing that such a talented person and most of their family and friends were taken away.

- [21 Lessons for the 21st Century](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41955387-21-lessons-for-the-21st-century) by Yuval Noah Harari: There is something so captivating about Yuval's work, it is written so well and presents so many great lessons about ethics, politics, self-improvement and world issues. Can't wait to read [Homo Deus](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31138556-homo-deus?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=0VBabcfNwH&rank=1) next.

- [The Precipice](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48570420-the-precipice) by Toby Ord: The main ideas presented in this book are [longtermism](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/qZyshHCNkjs3TvSem/longtermism) and the importance of [existential risks](https://futureoflife.org/background/existential-risk/#:~:text=An%20existential%20risk%20is%20any,to%20current%20standards%20of%20living.).

  I felt this book was quite repetitive and slow at the beginning, but it does pick up later on. This book also presented an [existential risk probability table](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwbqmbkdb/image/upload/v1586225593/Table_6.1_td3bzd.png):
  ![Probability Table - Toby Ord](https://res.cloudinary.com/dwbqmbkdb/image/upload/v1586225593/Table_6.1_td3bzd.png)  
  This was quite controversial on the [EA Forum](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Z5KZ2cui8WDjyF6gJ/some-thoughts-on-toby-ord-s-existential-risk-estimates). Regardless, it's a good intermediate book about EA and a good introduction to longtermism.

## Newsletters

- [BrainPint](https://brainpint.com/) by Janel Loi: One of my favourite "curator" newsletters, BrainPint brings really interesting advice and learning articles.
- [Future Perfect](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect) by Vox: A newsletter dedicated to effective altruism? Sign me up. [Here is an interesting issue from the beginning of this month.](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22650920/leaded-gasoline-eradicated-public-health)

## Articles

- [Noticing Youâ€™re Confused](https://arr.am/2020/01/23/noticingconfusion/) by Arram Sabeti: An incredible piece about practical rationality and a wonderful (and scary) true story all around.
- [Aaron's Epistemics Stories](https://emma-abele.notion.site/Aaron-s-Epistemics-Stories-72cb58cd5cd442489c9b60253157799f) by Aaron Gertler: Another wonderful story by the EA Forum moderator.
- [EffectiveAltruismData.com: A Website for Aggregating and Visualising EA Data](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/CQaNyJfsRFZhseiLZ/effectivealtruismdata-com-a-website-for-aggregating-and?utm_source=EA+Forum+Digest&utm_campaign=63c442a730-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2021_09_15_08_58&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_7457c7ff3e-63c442a730-319019336) by Hamish Huggard: The post that led me to become part of Effective Altruism Data!
