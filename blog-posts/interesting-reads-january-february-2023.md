I log everything I read in Notion. In these two months, I've read 2 books, 14 newsletters and 2 articles.

Here are some of the highlights of this month!

## Books

- [Avoiding the Worst](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/63105075-avoiding-the-worst) by Tobias Baumann - A [free book](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/XyCLLYkBCPw44jpmQ/new-book-on-s-risks) that does an excellent job on explaining s-risks (of course), but also adjacent cause areas, such as animal welfare, community building, artificial general intelligence and digital sentience, etc. I highly recommend giving this e-book a spin.

- [What If? 2](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60268621-what-if-2) by Randall Munroe - A great sequel to an already excellent concept. Nothing much else to say other than its pretty entertaining and most of the jokes stick the landing quite well.

## Newsletters

- The usual Future Perfect round-up: [Why science is slowing down](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/1/11/23549993/science-research-progress-studies-disruption-technology-artificial-intelligence-biotechnology) and [Operation Warp Speed](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/1/18/23560407/operation-warp-speed-pandemics-vaccines-covid-white-house-biden-trump) are my favourites.

- Another excellent set of Astral Codex Ten posts ([1](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/how-do-ais-political-opinions-change), [2](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/crowds-are-wise-and-ones-a-crowd)).

## Articles

- See the art of questioning being tackled in [this article](https://bigthink.com/leadership/the-skill-of-questioning/) that was brought to my attention by [BrainPint](https://brainpint.com/).
