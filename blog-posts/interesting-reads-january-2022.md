I log everything I read in Notion. This month I read 1 book, 69 newsletters and 30 articles.

Here are some of the highlights of this month!

## Books

- [The Life You Can Save by Peter Singer](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49084908-the-life-you-can-save) - My first Peter Singer book! To me, this is the logical follow-up read to [Doing Good Better by William MacAskill](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23398748-doing-good-better). It's a more in-depth look into the core concepts of effective altruism.

## Newsletters

- Recently, [Vox's Future Perfect](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect) got a new writer, [Bryan Walsh](https://www.vox.com/2021/12/16/22839488/bryan-walsh-joins-vox-as-editor-of-future-perfect). [Here's a great piece from him](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2022/1/5/22867184/us-census-population-growth-slowdown-migration-birth-death).

- [Ali Abdaal's inspiring Sunday snippets](https://aliabdaal.com/newsletter/) has been a great way for me to get back into his content. [Here's a great snippet to get started with](https://aliabdaal.com/i-hired-an-accountability-coach/).

## Articles

- [Wait But Why's "Why Bugs Ruin Everything"](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/02/why-bugs-ruin-everything.html) is incredibly funny and relatable (fair warning, there are plenty of images of bugs!). On the other hand, their famous ["Your Life in Weeks"](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html) is sure to give you an existential crisis.

- [Get In The Van](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/cRsPfkyAKZ3crxynB/get-in-the-van) has to be one of the better [EA Forum](https://effective-altruism.com) posts I've read in a while.
