I log everything I read in Notion. In these two months, I've read 19 newsletters and 3 articles.

Here are some of the highlights of this month!

## Newsletters

- The usual Future Perfect round-up: [ChatGPT](https://link.vox.com/view/60fc3142c9f14776313e8c4ahufsc.17ea/80ddf541) and [the (potential) eradication of Tuberculosis](https://link.vox.com/view/60fc3142c9f14776313e8c4ahlmqw.13by/98008be8) for September and October respectively.

- Really impressed with some of the Astral Codex Ten posts in these past two months ([1](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/the-media-very-rarely-lies), [2](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/selection-bias-is-a-fact-of-life)).

## Articles

- Two EA Forum posts that I found intriguing in these past two months ([1](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ydfcCfRAQpneH2wpG/smallpox-eradication), [2](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/QjeruoGQmYZh2ZsCt/how-long-till-brussels-a-light-investigation-into-the) - full disclosure, I proof-read the second post).
