There are about [7.95 billion humans right now](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/un-population-projection-medium-variant?tab=chart&country=~OWID_WRL). If everything goes well, we could be around for another 800,000 years, which means there could be another ~100 trillion of us to come.

I've had a hard time trying to soak this fact in. 100 trillion doesn't mean very much to me. The vast number of humans that are left to exist might create a fuzzy gut reaction, but it doesn't fire something within me. But just because their numbers are large doesn't mean I can't care about them. The number of people who live in poverty and face easily preventable illnesses is enormous, yet I still care about these people. The number of animals slaughtered for meat is enormous, yet I still care about these animals. The number of beings that will exist in the future is enormous, yet I can still care about them.

Maybe what was underlying my disconnect with future people is that their presence feels immaterial. They don't exist, and they don't have a story. I don't have something I can easily get attached to. I'll (probably) never live long enough to see the trillions of beings that'll come into existence. An immense amount of suffering exists right now, and this suffering feels more emotionally salient to me. Yet it seems obvious to me that the beings that are alive now and the beings that will be alive hundreds or thousands of years later still have the same significance. A child dying today versus a child dying ten years later seems equally bad.

I thought I could only care for future generations if my caring was emotional. But the qualitative nature of my ability to care for something doesn't need to be emotional. I can care about things on an intellectual level as well. I can feel a sense of purpose and drive to change things that seem wrong, even if they do not move me.

The effort that is put into helping future beings flourish is minimal. We can ensure that people in the future live good lives, but somehow we live on the brink of squandering that potential every day. I realise that this is wrong and that this realisation can be enough to help me orient my life.
